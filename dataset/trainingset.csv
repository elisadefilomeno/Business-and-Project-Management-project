the phone cannot charge and the sims card do not work,negative
this is a piece of junk do not waste your money it started acting up just after the return date and there was no contact seller option available for me to contact them i bought it for my daughter going off to college as a gift imagine my frustration and worry when i cannot get in touch with her even after restarting it a million times she has  she is not able to send me a text message because the letters are running all over the screen even now the phone has to be turned off most of the time because of that i am so disappointed right now,negative

i purchased  phone i recieved the phone and the touch screen wasnt responding to the finger sent the phone back recieved my replacement but the screen is no longer working and my photos are still in the phone if i was to send it back so im wondering what to do at this point ,negative
after almost four months of ownership i sorely regret purchasing this piece of junk being misled by older higherrated reviews im already looking at finding a replacement keep your  in your pocket and stay away for your own sanityfirst off the blu dash  is part of a family of clones including the cherry mobile burst and lava xolo a if something comes out for one of the clones chances are it will also work with the dashunboxing everything about this phone screamed cheap chinese knockoff starting with the packaging for god knows what reason a giant sticker covered the display and was stuck to what would could be a semidecent screen protector do not bother with the manual unless you want a good laugh at how poorly translated it is even the manual offered on blus web site does not match at least the manual on the web explains how to seat the microsd card using the flipping metal slothardware the hardware is very poor quality within two months white spots developed on the display at this price point there is not much room to complain after enough battery pulls the flimsy back cover will not stay closed in place and you will be pulling the battery quite a bit more on the software laterwithin the last few weeks the phone now overheats especially when i use gps for an extended period such as waze consequently the phone reboots which makes it useless for navigatingthe phone ships with  mb of ram which is the bare minimum for ics even worse you are only allocated  mb because of this limitation i recommend rooting and tweaking the memory management not that it has  it is going to help much because you are just going to kill off much needed services sooner so take your pick either live with constantly restarting services or having android bog down and freeze bottom line these clones should have shipped with  gb at minimumthe phone comes with front and rear cameras but they are both horrible for anything more than basic pictures for the web the rear camera has a led flash but it has  it is weak ive tried switching to  mp for taking shots but the camera hardware is just lackingsoftware the phone originally shipped with a very buggy  rom and go launcher ex dump go and switch to a better launcher such as apex or nova  at least they will not lag or redraw on you as often there is not much bloatware you do get a fm radio app led flashlight weak a notes app portable hotspot stopwatch whatsapp world clock facebook and twitter an updated build featured the stock launcher and lacked a few social apps too bad that it was still buggythe broken english in the dialogs is rather annoying even worse are the power saver settings which do not make any sense whatsoever i just leave it off completelylag as mentioned  mb of ram is not enough to run ics with your apps your phone will lag no buenobattery life terrible keep chargers on hand especially if you listen to a lot of music after two months i noticed that my battery is not holding a charge like it used to even after wiping battery stats and calibrating where did blu find these cheap batteries fromstorage space  gb for internal storage and  gb for phone storage i highly recommend adding a microsd cardno google play services out of the box this is not the same as the google play store any apps that rely on this youtube google my tracks will simply refuse to work try installing google play services all you want it will fail blus update corrected thisphonedialer if i use heavy apps and i have an incoming call there is a noticeable delay before the incoming call screen appears on more than occasion i have missed calls because of this the speaker can be glitchy at times requiring a few onoff togglesno support i experienced first hand that blu does not stand by their products they will tell you to contact your distributor who are equally worthless when it comes to getting help not to mention i also saw the bit about the warranty not applying to the customer you might as well root and take total control of your device and try to fix the shortcomings yourselfbottom line keep your expectations in check this is a budget phone and you are getting what you pay for normally i root my android devices to get rid of annoying ads and to install titanium backup for backing up my apps i should not have to root to fix shortcomings such as the inadequate memory and out of the box management the hardware issues may not crop up until long after your warranty period unfortunately this phone is not worth much if you try to sell itstay far away from these phones last i heard there has  there is a newer version with jelly beanand the same limiting  mb ram good luck with that,negative

i ordered this on the fourth of august and it just came in the today august th when i opened it everything seemed ok other than a few cosmetic blemishes but then i pick it up and there has  there is a part loose in the phone i shake it and you can here it floating around everything seems to be working only now any time i move the phone it i hear a rattle i was not pleased at all it has  it is not worth sending back cause i need the phone right now but i definitely do not encourage anyone to buy from here i will not be purchasing anything else,negative
this phone freezes and closes out while using the browser and other apps this is a waste if time and money,negative
appears to be a fairly decent phone considering the price to performance ratio when first powering on and swiping to unlock to the home screen everything worked fine i then proceeded to remove a few of the factory set home screen icons and the analog clock plus install a few apps such as zedge  wifi file transfer all went well until i powered down and back up now when i power up and swipe to unlock to the home screen i get the  unfortunately launcher has stopped  prompt and have to hit the ok tab to continue on to the home screen i have gone in and cleared the launcher app cache and the only way to resolve the issue is to also clear the data in the factory installed launcher app but that returns the home screen back to the original factory setup dont know if installing a new separate launcher from the playstore and assigning it as the default launcher will fix this issue if not i will return this phone due to the software glitches associated with the kitkat version i assume in this specific phone that is causing the problem plus i have an old school flip phone on the same tmobile plan as this new phone and it gets better signal strength then the posh titan side x side in the exact same location the titan has also on power up gone into the loop testing mode several times so far requiring me to remove the battery the phone is definitely going back as i obviously got a lemon total waste of my time  money,negative
the phone was purchased  november  the screen failed in august  contacted the supplier mobiles international who stated this phone does not have a warranty we replace all defective units within  days from the date of delivery if you purchased a warranty from an external source such as cps squaretrade or geeksquad please reach out to themcontacted samsung in the usa who noted the phone is international and not supported in the usa by samsungso be aware there is only a  warranty on this phone,negative

thought it was bigger and over heats,negative
love the idea but not a great product we always had to double check before my son left the house that it was sending and recieving calls properly sometimes it would work and other times it would not it also seems to use up minutes extrememly fast and only hold a charge for about a day when not in use it has  it is difficult to purchase more minutes on the sim with this device i would have to take out the sim and put it in a regular phone to add minutes unless my son talked directly into the watch it was difficult to understand what he was saying which makes the monitor feature useless the text codes that enable the phone to call back would take minutes to call back if at all we tried to use it for the last two months and finally just gave him one of our old phones to use,negative
i do not like it it is not functioning right,negative
not only did i have to wait a long time for the product it has already malfunctioned out of no where the screen stopped working  i really want my money back but luckily i can still talk on it at least,negative
 for  month usage of the device my lg g stopped working after being in a case for  months but i liked the physical layoutsw enough powervolume button layout  double tap screen to turn onoff to buy the lg g so i get the g and as soon as i get it the area near the power button was hot with the screen above  i keep the phone caseless to try to avoid the g experience and st drop screen cracks g took  falls before i even bought a case unfortunately im out of town for the month when it cracked  was unable to return the device so guess who has a very expensive brick this guy,negative

this cellphone is cheap in price and quality i have to walk all over the place to get a connection or for the receiver to hear me if dropped sometimes battery falls out,negative
in less than  months the phone is useless the sound starting going out after just a few weeks then totally stopped working and then the power button broke so there was no way to turn my phone on the only way to get the phone to come on was if someone called in and i happen to notice the screen turn on since there was no sound only could use headphones to hear anything very shoddy phone and had to get yet another phone not from here never from here again ,negative
before i write this review some history i used this phone for over  year before this i owned a nokia n for  years a nokia  for  years and a nokia  before that needless to say i was a big time nokia fanboy i was really impressed by nokias innovation sturdiness of their phones and the ease of usability and sleek designs some might say that ofcourse changed after n i have one sentence that sums up this phone it does a lot of things but does not do anything well i will go over each of its major components and tell why there is a problem camera by far the best feature of this phone this is where nokia did well unlike other phone manufacturers they did not make a phone which also has a camera they made a phone  camera the lens is great and the resolution is great the quality of pictures and all the available options makes it as close to a real camera as possible however i compare it to the camera on n and i am less than satisfied the earlier camera was a lot more ergonomically stable and the lens cover was a lot nicer but im not going to complain too much about it still the quality of images i get are a little less satisfactory than n and it did not entirely replace my existing camera i give it an phone itself the phone interface is really weird who sets automatic landscape setting on the phone itself i go and try to answer a phone call and the bloody thing is trying to reset the orientation so i have to wait before the image comes back on the phone wtf and then there is the connectivity if for some reason i go out of network and then back in there are chances it wont connect for a while while my friend who has the exact same carrier as me is enjoying a conversation im still waiting for a bloody signal it is disappointing when the function like calling and receiving calls seamlessly should be the first thing the phone does i give it navigation a new feature which was installed after i bought the phone good except its not very good when working offline kinda sucks when you go out of network but some genius decided that a navigation software does not need a history what you mean i have to type the entire address everytime i add it what if for some reason i accidentally exit retype what if i go there everyday retype weird and there is no bell or anything like normal navigation systems to warn you to turn now silly music player first is the sync if you transfer music via the mass memory feature then you wont see the songs in your list but if you sync them via the media sync feature then you will i dont understand why there cannot be one simple way to transfer everything why do you have to keep changing the mode also if you push the back button on the song guess what it takes you back to the main phone screen hey i only wanted to go back to the album no sir you cannot do that at all gets really annoying especially if you are listening to music in the car touch and keyboard the responsiveness of the touch screen is average the touch keyboard is again a genius design why make the touch keyboard just like the old phones when you had to click on one key  times to type c is not that the point of the touch keyboard the thing appears on a screen why not have all the letters of the alphabet there every other manufacturer does it why are you the only idiots who do not and then you do not even give people the option why why why memory and operating system wow if there is anything that put the final nail on the coffin was this bit of the phone lets talk about the memory first nokia says the phone has gb memory to be fair that is true if you want to transfer your music pictures etc etc yes it has gb of memory what they however fail to mention is that there is something called a nand memory which is only mb what is this memory you ask why its only the place where the entire operating system and most critical apps sit things like maps push email sit here there is no way to transfer them to the mass memory as its called by nokia i wonder what the designers of this phone were thinking in this day and age of all these apps that go on to smart phones mb was going to be enough you run out of memory very quickly and then are left to try and figure out ways to free up memory it gets old really quickly and starts impacting your phone performance the operating system is just the worst thing ever dreamt up it has so many things wrong with it that i do not know where to begin first off finding any of the functions it does do is a full time job in itself on top of that it flashes a message every time you are out of network you cannot make it go away i have tried no imagine you are receiving a call since my carrier does not have that capability a message will flash while the call is coming in that data exchange is not possible i know just let me answer the phone nope it will flash that message for however long and then you can take your call combine that with the automatic landscape feature voila its almost a second before you are allowed to answer your phone call you are a bloody phone first let me get to my phone call and the features like weather and email widgets should not they connect to the internet and retrieve your emails automatically they do for the first  mins and then stop doing it if god forbid you get disconnected from network for some reason the connection aint coming back unless you start it manually genius oh yeah and the phone software crashes a lot requiring a restart almost every day ovi store when i bought this phone i knew it was not an iphone so i was not expecting the app store but it should still work right here is my experience i tried downloading an app and paid for it like a responsible consumer but there was an error while downloading guess what happened it could not find my app there was no way i could go back and redownload it because it was not there i tried contacting the ovi store there was no phone number listed so i emailed them it took them a week to get back to me and they were not able to understand my problem how hard is it to send me a link to enable me to redownload the app i am not trying to get it for free ive already paid for it my card was charged finally i get someone on the phone who tries to blame my network for it and sends me a download link which i have to use in the next  hours or it will disappear i used the same link over my network without any issues the problem was with ovi store its even a lame name to be honest there are a bunch of free apps too which are tried they are all bad other complaints i have ranted a lot here and i hope people read this and stay away from this phone frankly i am done for life with nokia products i read things about their new n phone and saw similar issues with it here are some more issues i encountered  my charging port broke now the only way the phone will charge is if i put it at a certain angle and connect it to my pc would not help if i were travelling now would it i think its past its warranty period so no point contacting anyone  the minisd card is just plain hard to use the card does not pop out all the way so you are left trying to pry the card using your finger nails praying it does not break anything all in all shows how bad the design is whatever was good about nokia was destroyed by this phone i paid  for this phone and i do not think its unreasonable at that price to expect that stuff works not only did it not but the things about nokia like sturdiness innovation design etc that i mentioned earlier are absent i am thru with nokia for good and want to warn everyone before buying a nokia as it seems they do not want to test their products anymore,negative

i am sad to write a bad review on this phone because there were many things i liked but what is most important to me is taking good pictures of my kids for this you cannot use the special camera feature that is designed to take better still life pictures for movement you have to keep the camera on regular there is no good way to change camera settings you cannot chose action photo nighttime etc you can choose flash on off or auto the flash doesnt work properly after having this happen to me i saw online it happens to others for pictures inside of my fast moving kids i need to use a flash or the picture is blurry with this phone the flash goes off then turns off prior to the phone actually snapping the picture i tested with and without flash and the picture is brighter without the flash i tried for a few weeks and sadly the final result was just losing out of some great pictures of my young children the other other negative for me for this camera which may be with any camera is by the end of the day the battery would go out i did not use it that much during the day but i also am not on wifi during the day i had hoped the battery would last a full ampm day with intermittent use otherwise i did really like the phone but having to send it back it gets only a  star,negative

i purchased this phone through pure mobility and was sent a phone with a battery that did not even last a full day on which the internet and signal were spotty at best although i did notice a small chip in the plastic on the side of the phone i dismissed this as it arrived with a screen protector in what appeared to be sealed original packaging assuming the unreliable service was a problem with the carrier i took my phone in multiple times to ultimately find out thata the phone had been through at least two registered users before me i purchased and activated it in b the phone was likely sufferering damage from water submersionexposure as some connections were faulty and the supposedly new battery held a charge poorly and was entirely missing its liquid indicator sticker it became very warm while charging and the store clerks told me that batteries exposed to water pose a potential fire risk and i should not have been using itthe actually new exhilerate i got through my carrier works like a charmhighly recommend it fast responsive easy to use small enough to fit in my pocket unlike many other of the galaxies which are becoming larger and large with each successive model however avoid pure mobility at all coststhey are running a scam and im very disappointed at amazon for trusting these con artists as a fulfilled by seller,negative

i have had two of these devices the first lasted about two weeks before the primary side button used for turning the phone on and off and for unlocking it stopped functioning entirely i was only able to unlock the phone at that point by plugging it in to charge this was as you can imagine fairly impracticalthe replacement phone lasted six months before facing the same issueduring the months in which the replacement was working i also faced the issue of the phone losing its ability to connect to wifi networks it originally was able to but at some point began experiencing an issue where it would see the networks but could connect to none regardless of security type this was only solved via a factory reset again not exactly practicalthere have been other minor issues  google maps is locked out probably microsofts fault the browser crashes moderately frequently and i cannot uninstall all of the apps which i do not want  but those would only be enough to bump it down to four stars without other problems at this price point i do not expect much and an lte capable unlocked phone at  can get away with a lot of annoyances before it has  it is not worth the cost still at any price i do expect a phone that works and sadly this one simply does notthis is not meant to be a knock against nokia as they were very helpful during the replacement process it has  it is merely an indictment of this specific phone it has  it is just not very good,negative

i bought this blackberry thinking that it was g phone as it was advertised in the product description when i bought it and until about a week ago the description used to say blackberry torch  white unlocked gsm g world phone with g bands  and now they changed it for blackberry torch  white wifi unlocked gsm quadband g cell phone i guess they changed because they realized their mistake still they refuse to return my money back which i think is a fraudafter i got the phone and used it for less than  weeks i noticed that it was even slower than my former g bb so i took it to my phone provider to check what was going on and they told me that the problem was that my new blackberry was g not g as advertised when i wrote to the seller saying that this was not the product i was expecting and i wanted to return it they saydepending on which carrier you are using it with will determine what speed you can get and if g is available but i have gone ahead and authorized your return request so you can send it back to usi was happy that at least i will get my money back but a couple of weeks after i returned the item they wrote me an email saying that they will only refund  for the blackberry i returned even though i paid  this means they are taking  from me and they do not recognize that it was their responsibility to have advertised the product mistakenlyi have called the seller  times and talked to different people from the department of returns and costumer services and they always find that im right but they do not have the authority to give my money back the last time i called the agent run out of arguments and told me he will transfer me to his supervisor which it turned out to be a voice mail unacceptable they always say that the person in charge will call me back and he never didthis whole process has been absolutely annoying and timeconsuming i felt absolutely cheated and nobody in the company was willing to take responsibility of their mistake misleading advertisement and then my money stolen i would never ever will buy from this seller again after all i guess it is time to change to an apple device where they do care for the costumer satisfactioni will also fill out a consumer complaint with the directory of state and local consumer agencies and will see what happens i really hope that the seller will call me back recognize their error and return the rest of my money,negative

i have recently purchased three nokia lumia phones one  and two s i have had nothing but problems with all three the  would not charge and would not boot after finally getting advice from microsoft a master reset solved the problem as for the two s inserting the nano sim into the adapter and into the sim slot is very difficult so difficult that i broke a sim connection prong in the process seating the nano sim into the adapter is not easy and not always successful that phone is now a paper weight the second  would not charge would not boot and repeated attempts at a master reset never worked it showed signs of executing the reset but it never worked i returned it for a refund so my experience with lumia phones has been a disaster i would not recommend this phone the cheap price is not worth it this is no bargain,negative

the evo g i purchased from amazons merchant midstar was defective according to my local sprint repair store the phone had been reprogrammed before i received it midstars response was i believe sprint might not know how to activate the phone because we have purchased them directly from our sprint supplier we have also received activation instructions from them really the rep at the sprint store was kind enough to replace the defective phone with one of theirs less than  minutes later i am out the door with a working phone i guess they know how to program a phone after all secondly i was also informed that the battery that was supplied with the midstar phone was not one of theirs ergo also defective as it barely fits into the phone  dollars later i have a phone and battery that is what i paid for sprint customer service to the rescue,negative
although we knew it was a used phone we certainly did not expect the previous owners call history to be intact although the seller did not specifically claim it to be reconditioned as he quite rudely pointed out when we returned it it came as a disappointing shock to find all the previous owners personal phone numbers and data still in the phone beware empty your phone before turning it in or selling it you never know where it will end up,negative

like the phone but i think it has  it is cheep they do not send a changer with it for  you think it come with it totally dissatisfied with it,negative
the internet reviews for this phone looked really good and so as my blackberry was dying i decided to purchase one firstly it did not arrive by the guaranteed shipping date it arrived  days later i originally had it shipped to a friends house but because it arrived  days late he had left the country so we had to convince the fedex guy to allow the neighbour to sign for it then ship it to a new address which had an additional cost attached to it when i finally got the phone and opened it up the manual was missing from the box  maybe it was a used phone when i finally loaded my sim card and made the first call i realized the microphone was not working anyone interested in purchasing this phone search for forums about microphone not working in lumia  on the internet unfortunately i did not pick up on this earlier the microphone has a noise reduction feature which sometimes cancels out your voice completely so the person on the other end does not hear you at all sure it works fine on speaker and videocam because that uses a different microphone apparently it is a design flaw in the lumia  and nokia does not seem to be doing anything about it all those fancy features yet the basic thing a phone is supposed to be able to do is allow you to make and receive calls and the lumia  is incapable of doing that what a waste of money disappointed,negative

its been a great phone so far battery lasts all day and has a nice large display its not super fast opening programs but you just cant beat it for the price the only quirky thing it does is sometimes it wont fully turn on during the boot up cycle it just kind of hangs requiring me to take the battery out and try again it always works the second time though i would say i encounter this problem once or twice a week it has done this since the phone was new i bought it feb just an update to say this phone did not make it one year before the touch screen went out on it the display works when i power on the device but it does not respond to touch this happened while the phone was sitting on my kitchen counter while i was reading recipes from it it was not damaged it just stopped working downgrading review to one star,negative
its to bad cant not install anything,negative

disaster the phones reception was terrible and it had a short battery life on top of that the charger broke after a week with the phone saying that it was not a certified charger the problem with cheap charger is that it kills your battery or so they say so all those suspicious glowing reviews may not be happy after  monthsok so after all that i return it and using my tracking number i see that they received it then i waited for a refund but it never came i contact them and they said that i have to give them a tracking number in order to get a refund that was not a part of the return policy at that point i could not find my tracking number so i had to beg my post office for copy another waste of  hoursthe worst part is that this phone is not even a great deal i got a new brand model from boost mobile for the same price if you want one on the verizon network then go with a groupon deal  again for the same price do not risk a refurbished unless there is a steep discountlastly if you want a free phone just buy one from these guys and return an empty box yes they are so disorganized that they will give you a refund i did not do this but you certainly can,negative

do you want a phone that is reliable do you want a phone that stays turned on and does not constantly restart or freeze do you use your phone as an alarm for work and need it to function properly if the answer is yes then buy a different phone this phone lasted  hours before it started to have problems before i even got service to it the screen started developing cracks in the glass what caused it my only guess is aliens snuck into my apartment took it off my desk and chiseled alien codes into the screen ive owned the phone for  months and it freezes  times a day the phone also gets stuck in constant reboot cycles seemingly at random just to freeze again after about the th reboot could the alien code and the freezingreboots be related could the aliens be trying to communicate with humans but im too stupid to realize their code these could be explanations for the problems i have each day with this phone it could also be that the phone is just a  cleveland steamer that amazon delivered to my door i would just assume i got a lemon but there are  others at my office that have blu phones and they all have the same issues minus the aliens chiseling the secrets of the universe into their screens guess i just got lucky thanks blu you managed to make an affordable piece of crap and sell it as a smart phone,negative

the hardwarecall quality  excellent typical of all nokia phonesthe build quality  excellent typical of all nokia phonesthe screen  good vibrant scratch resistant and repels facial grease is not gorilla glass and is noticeably more fragileloudspeaker  a little on the soft sidethe softwarei have been an avid windows user since windows  and a windows phone user since windows phone windows over the years has gotten more capable and much faster with time windows xp to vista was a little buggy but it worked windows vista to  was just a case of slothering vista in butter and polishing it up to a fine sheenwindows phone  to windows phone  has been the experience nightmares are made of it was basically going from windows  to windows windows phone  was an elegant experience for me minus some minor quirks here and there the most noticeable one was the inability to assign more than one mobile number to any one contact which was rather odd others were like not being able to multiselect files or difficulty putting ringtones and audiobooks on the devicethey were not deal breakers and there were some workarounds that said everything else in the os was fully functional the phones available has very limited storage most maxing out at gbs however as many figured out the st generation wp devices uses microsd cards in place of soldered in onboard memory and with a little trick and the right sd card could take a gb phone and transform it into a gb phone i did it with no problems on my gb dell venue pro even better integration with the zune desktop software zds made syncing music pictures podcasts and videos to a lesser extent a breezewhen i got home i put my phone to charge it would ping my desktop wirelessly fire up the zds and start syncing my new podcasts and music automatically to my phone when i left for work the next morning everything just workedwindow phone  is nothing like that with this new os expandable storage is natively supported except on my lumia  it does not work at all when i put in my sandisk gb microsdxc card and fired up windows media player to sync my playlists as i did with my zune and windows phones on the zds i did this with my old sandisk e player back in the playforsure days as wellmy first thought wow this is slowsecond thought why is song taking to long to transfer minutes later why is the same song still transferring minutes later oh uck it frozethen something that never happened on my wp dell venue pro happened my music and video app crashed so did my settings app on shutting it down it was permanently frozen on the goodbye screeni forced restarted it by removing the batterywhen i powered it up the sd card was missing i turned off the phone removed the card and put it back in powered the phone on and it was still missing i took the card out and put it in a card reader on the pc the disc check utility detected an inconsistency on the card and ran but found no errors once it was back in the phone the phone saw it once more i tried syncing a playlist again it transferred on playlist and froze in the middle of anotherthis happened over and over then i quick formatted the card back in exfat on my pc and tried syncing playlists directly to the card without the phone between them every song synced perfectlyonce back in my phone all the songs turned up but for some odd reason some songs would turn up with no artist or album information if i resynced them or copied them manually they would then show with the correct info but then other songs would start doing the same thing to no fault of the songs themselves because they all worked fine on my zunes and dvpusing explorer to drag and drop lots of small numerous files music and pics mainly always results in some sort of freezing during copyingin the end i gave up although i was able to do some podcast subscriptions directly on my phone by changing my country to usa so i could have some sort of entertainment on my phone for when i was driving or waiting in line this is still a problem because when i want to view podcasts on my tv or desktop while i work with my nice sounding speakers i cannotover the last  days something else has started happening which is doubly annoying for some odd reason my music videos and pictures have started duplicating and triplicating themselvesif i plug in the phone and navigate to the directory there is only one physical file even thought the phone sees  or  of themwhats worse is if i delete even one of the duplicates all of the duplicates including the original are deletedthe nokia lumia  is a horrible phonethis is coming from someone who has owned only nokia phones his whole life aside for a dell venue pro and an ericsson and has been a massive fan of microsofts zune software and hardware devices as well as the windows phone  line of devicesnothing works like it ought to and despite how much i loved wp i cannot recommend this phone to anyone out therei cannot even return it for a refund because it was bought in the usa and i live in trinidad and tobagoif other windows phone  handsets give the same problem as this lumia  i recommend avoiding them until microsoft and the oems get their house in order and fix what was not broken in windows phone  to begin with,negative

the most ugly phone on the high end market ugly oblong shape cheap shiny plastic look ugly design of icons oversaturated colors even in basic mode and messy organization of apps and screens extra features like pulse sensing have marginal value at best good features dual simm large screen size to phone size ratio low weight waterproofing do not fully compensate for ugly design given a chance i would go for any other phone especially htc,negative

i personally think samsung as a company should concentrate on home appliances and forget about phones everyone can make a phone but the customer service after purchase is the most important i will recommend everyone to buy an iphone international they have the best service centre and when it comes to hardware problems they will be eager to replace it is not just about having a phone but its about having a gadget in which you get an easier customer serviceinternationally samsung sucks their warranty for a year is just a joke if you have a problem and you take it to a samsung dealer internationally the level of customer service is terrible i have no problem with their phones but they should pay a lot more attention to after sales service than be in an unnecessary competition with an iphone iphone has the best after sales service system compared to any phonei will rather look into that when using phones abroadphones are made in a batch systemthis means that they are assembled in a system and not by human hands by this method one or two or many out of that batch can go bad after use for sometime so you if you end with any of this you need a good after sales service that will retake it and get you another one or even especially in cases of hardware errorsthat is why it is expedient to buy a phone with a good after sales service system internationally apple has done a much better job at that than samsung get an iphone instead,negative

after using it for a week i have decided to dump this phone there has never been a time when i have received a call successfully in the first go most of the time it is the person on the other side who never hears me they have to call me again and when i hang up the phone the phone hangs up on me i have to take out the battery and restart the phone every time some times they are not only able to hear me but also themselves very loud and clear once i called up on it just to verify it it was true from another mobile and i can hear the echo so clearly that i felt there was a third person who was part of the conversation and was repeating my words had it not been me who paid for this piece of crap i would have found it pretty funny probably would have thanked nokia for making my words not only loud but doubly clearand now i am stuck with it because i got it from states and had it shipped to india and now i probably cannot even get it repaired here,negative

i wanted so badly to like this phone but the reality is it just is not very good first and foremost the screen is often nonresponsive this makes using itwell impossible the gps on the phone is also horrific it often thinks i am  streets away from where i am  even on major highways i have a blu hd  and this is not a problem the camera like most cheap phone cameras is only reasonably okay outdoors inside you just will not get a good picture also when plugged in it seems to cause a short in the screen which becomes very erratic at best i could not track any sort of discernible pattern of what it is doing its just not usable at all while plugged in yes with the factory charger and cableto give credit where its due its reasonably durable as i tried to smash it into my center console out of frustration and the screen did not break though the whole phone did bend as on  i still have not had lolipop pushed to this phone as well,negative

update phone is still garbage with no usable storage space because of verizon and samsung bloat ware as well as the constantly corrupted sd card phone at least recognizes the card now it just recognizes that it has corrupted it againagain you probably will not be able to buy this phone for much longer since it has  it is now two generations old which is just as well because it is terribleupdate after sending the phone in for a warranty repair to try to fix the issue with the phone constantly corrupting microsd cards i received the phone back with a note indicating that samsung could not find a problem with the phone and just sent it back to me since receiving the phone back a month ago i have stopped saving apps on the sd card only saving photos on it in the hopes that it would prevent the corruption problem unfortunately and perhaps predictably it has begun corrupting microsd cards again causing me to lose all my photos on my phone once againi cannot emphasize this enough  do not buy this phoneoriginal reviewi bought this to replace my beloved galaxy s which had served me for three years without major problems but was getting a little slow thanks to larger more demanding apps from the start i was getting a constant check battery cover warning despite the fact that the back was firmly attached in the  months i have had it the phone has corrupted five micro sd cards of various sizes and manufacturers and has required factory resetting twice just to get the phone to functionwith the majority of the inbuilt storage taken up by verizon bloatware this leaves scant space for apps which really requires a large sd card however when the phone is constantly burning up your sd cards rendering them unrecoverable and completely unrecognized when plugged into computers there has  there is really no point in having this over the scurrently the phone is awaiting a warranty call from samsung because it has fried yet another micro sd card and claims that many apps that are installed are not installed on the phone it has  it is also corrupted the majority of the photos that ive taken and stored to the sd card thank goodness for dropbox cloud backupsultimately do not buy this phone you may get one that works or you may get a giant headache that could be solved by either spending more and buying a new one or buying a better phone,negative

i purchased this cell phone because i was a big samsung fan after buying a laser printer from them last year i was in the market for an unlocked cell phone that had wifi camera and bluetooth the samsung i had everything i was looking forfirst of all as a cell phone the clarity was fine but my calls dropped far more often than i had ever experienced with my old motorola flip phoneas a camera the i was adequate not the crystal clear images that you get with a dedicated digital camera but certainly a nice camera to have in your cell phone the lack of flash limits the photos you can capturebut the worst thing for me was the wifi connection the touch screen keyboard was not very friendly when it came to entering the wifi login info and after i did there was no connection to the wifi thinking i mistyped the password i tried again and again and again no luck finally i went into the room in which the router was located and tried logging in again this time i connected to my home wifi but as soon as i walked a few feet away from the router the connection ended i have an imac on another floor in my home and always have a solid wifi connection so i know there is nothing wrong with the router for whatever reason the i had a wifi range of  feeti called samsungs tech support for assistance with this issue their response to me was that i had to call england since the i was not sold in the united states rather than pay for an international phone call i decided that i had to return the phone to amazoni do not know if i had a lemon or if this was a flaw design in the i but in my opinion this was not a pleasant consumer experience i had high hopes for the i but was met with great disappointment,negative

false advertising tmobile users beware i purchased two of these phones the first in june  from amazon and the second one in sep  directly from alcatel who used amazon to fulfill the order my primary reason for the purchases was support for tmobile band  and the price point well for the last couple of months the signal quality has been noticeably worsemissing calls texts etc i tried to think back to what changed and i remembered an ota update in janurary from alcatel after some research i discovered that alcatels janurary ota firmware update removed support for tmobile band  they actually took away the feature that was my primary reason for purchase no warnings no communications it was done secretly and now i have two phones that perform very poorly when i contacted them their response was basically screw youtoo bad i have read they have no plans to update it and make it work it has  it is bringing your new car to the dealer for an oil change and them removing your transmission without telling you leaving you with a useless hunk of metal shame on you alcateltcl and amazon i would hope that you would make this right somehow but not holding my breath,negative

do not be like me and assume that people are just getting a dud when they give a bad review of a phone i got mine  weeks ago and it has given me grief every day it will either lock up or shut down randomly the apps on it want to work every other day some phone calls do not ring and when you miss them they do not show a missed call the biggest issue is when it locks up though it happens when my phone runs dead i will charge it and try and boot it up but does not work they tell you to force restart does not work by the end of it the phone decides it wants to work and you do not know how the hell it turned back on stay clear of this phone its cheap for a smart phone but your paying way too much for a dud,negative

so far i have two major issues  poor signal reception rate  whenever i am in a relatively poor signal reception area i almost instantly lose signals or at least the devices connection become very unstable  poor camera quality i get it this is a budget phone with some premium end features but the camera has become a very important aspect in many peoples everyday use and yet this is very very bad under bright sunlit this performs not bad but even with a slightly dim condition the camera starts to perform horribly ois does not save it the photos lose detail and get blurry these two glaring issues made me hate this phoneother minor things  the hifi feature is actually very confusingly set up hifi super hifi standard dolby also mifavor ui still has a long long long way to go  still feels like a dev device rather than a consumers  like the galaxy ss eraat this price range i would consider other options like oneplus  and maybe last years premium phones if you want great camera while losing some raw horsepower this phone has a great screen on par with note  and great speakersdacs but other than those meh,negative
liars their claims of it being unlocked is totally false well lesson learned there has  there is no need to even bother buying from this vendor i made a big mistake buying this phone thinking id save some steps in setting it up one reason was my eye cataract seeing small print was an issue for me after my surgery i looked this pos phone over it has  it is missing a lot of firmware options i made a comparison of this phone and a friends unlocked phone these crucial firmware options when missing turns this phone into a very expensive paperweight i do not even know why they crippled their product maybe they think doing something like this is somehow helpful for whatever country they are from i really do not know all i do know is i have a finite amount of finances i do not need this and i do not want this either,negative

my brother bought the note  n with premium pricing as it was advertised by the seller as being factory unlocked and international version my brother lives in asia and was visiting me in the us for a week the buying experience turned out to be a disaster for the following reasons  paid premium pricing for the model but still had to pay for shipping even though i am an amazon prime member the phone turned out to be locked as it did not work when my brother put in his sim card from asia it asked for a sim network unlock code when i called the seller the first time they told me that they did not have a tech support team and that we need to contact samsung directly samsung confirmed it was not factory unlocked we also stopped by multiple electronic stores in chicago and they all confirmed that the phone was not factory unlocked they could not unlock the phone as we would need a us phone service provider to get an unlock code when i contacted the seller worldwide distributors they fed me some technical gibberish and asked us to buy a brand new sim card for it work any sim card should work in a factory unlocked phone supposedly a brand new sim work would unlock the phone did not make sense how but we tried it we bought an att sim card to test out their theory it did not work when my brother would put in his sim card from asia again it still required a unlock code we shelled out more money to get an unlock code from the netwe ended up paying way more and wasting  days to get this functional so that my brother can use it in asiaalso i did not even bother contacting the seller to ask if they would reimburse me for all the additional cost we incurred to get the phone unlocked i was wnot happy with their customer service when i contacted them and felt it would have been a waste of my time and potentially more money when i asked about their return policy they emailed me saying that i need to pay for shipping when returning the phone,negative

i would like to alert shoppers using amazon that some of these samsung galaxy s duos ii phones that are advertised for international use could very well be clonesknock offs of samsung products earlier this year i purchased one of these phones through a seller that sells products via amazon upon delivery i immediately noticed that the phone charger that was shipped with the phone did not mate up correctly to the phone so i needed to use a charger that i used on an old blackberry instead also i noted that the picture quality of the camera was pretty low grade which surprised me since samsung generally has good camera quality after longer use other strange things like my contact list would appear complete some days and then other days would be missing most of my contacts eventually every call that i was receiving would have the phone number of the caller but the name of the caller would be using only chinese characters i am using the phone in the usthe other day i ended up going to a tmobile store in my city and showed them the phone and the weirdness i was seeing since i was using one of their sim cards and they looked a the phone in detail it turns that they noticed that the case style was slightly different from a standard samsung build and that the file structure of the android os was missing key operating files that appear on samsung phones the blue tooth was not functioning either they came to the conclusion that the phone was a clonecounterfeit product considering all the tell tale signs noted above they noted that samsung products are commonly counterfeited and not only just this model i confirmed this with my own researchthe only good thing that i can say about this cloned samsung galaxy s duos phone is that at bare minimum the wifi function worked and i could insert a sim card from a country i visited in se asia and was able to at least make a phone call on that phone network otherwise for the price i paid for this phone and the problems that i managed to discover i basically got snookered there may be some legitimate sellers that are selling legitimate samsung galaxy s duos ii phones but considering the age of this model there are likely fewer phones in the s or older line up that are legitimateunmodifiedi am not sure i am allowed to list the name of the seller of this phone but if someone from amazon can follow up with me i would be happy to provide the name of the seller and send the phone back to amazon for their counterfeit product investigations organization to study based on my experience with this phone i would be very cautious about buying a phone on amazon unless it was through a main line vendor with a good reputation sometimes that is hard to determine so be careful everyone,negative

let me start by saying the look  feel of the phone was exceptional i thought i had struck gold with this phone but i was new to a android operating system  i own a ipad and love the simplicity of the os and it provided me with a rude awakening of what was in store the owners manual is one sheet of paper and it starts off with the premise that the as delivered configuration of the phone need not be explained or instructions need not be provided hence the phone would only remain on for a few seconds and then promptly shut down being new  to android environment made my situation worse i did reach tech support of my cell carrier who markets this phone hoping for some online assistance the person told me i could clear any settings and put the phone in oem baseline configuration by a simultaneous manipulation of the power key and some other key which i cannot recall doing this did not reboot the phone as promised  but rather caused the screen to rapidly flash on and off  over and over when i asked the tech support was this normal he replied that the phone had a total failure and was now totally useless he implied that this was not the first time that this had occurred with this model of the blu phone such a beautiful phone stuck with such poor user manual,negative

this product is not what it is made out to be at allwhen i bought it i did because i believed samsung was a superior product that i could trust i was especially pleased with certain aspects of it the gorilla glass processor and metal build and aesthetic design set it apart from the competition and entitled the company to my money or so i thought i was ready to be wowed and when i opened the box i really was the phone is sleek and thin and the glass thick and strong and clear i was impressed and hopeful because this was the most i had spent on a phone so fari previously used a nokia lumia  which was about the same weight but was wider and took spectacular pictures it was roughly  dollars cheaper i was impressed with that phone and wanted to invest in my upgrade in something that would last me a year or two and would serve its purpose so i did my research and found the s edge plusi have had the samsung s edge plus for about  and a half months and within days of owning it i had it safely tucked away in a phone casei have dropped it for between the th time total always about  feet down from my desk and mainly onto carpet although today was different today it was from my keyboard at work onto the laminate flooring the entire screen fractured and spider webbed the very first time i dropped this phone onto a level flat but tough surface from a height of  feet the entirety of the screen cracked gorilla glass indeedthe quickcharger i received with the phone quit working after two weeks which was annoying but i could easily forgive that i replaced it and it worked fine after thatfinally one of the main reasons i bought this phone was the processor i was looking for something that was top of the line for what was available even performing menial tasks with the phone sent it into all sorts of glitches one was that the keyboard would remain open even after responding to messages and it would stay through several different menus obscuring much of the screen the phone would just turn black sometimes and would constantly freeze when changing between applications restarting would usually solve the problem but it was never a short process ranging from  minutes onwardtldr when the phone worked it worked but do not believe the fantasy that gorilla glass is any more resilient than ordinary screens do not believe that with all of the metal frame and top notch hardware that is advertised it will work any better than a regular phone and do not expect the phone to last very long at all unless done exceedingly carefully  months of service is not worth the tag my nokia lasted nearly two years with only some minor issues with the charge portmight i recommend a nokia lumia for you or perhaps even an iphone anything else android just do not buy samsung their best is certainly not up to par,negative

i have tested two separate units and the results are the same there appears to be an lte issue with att it just drops completely then comes back then drops again constantly it does not fall back to hspa if you change the network mode to hspa it will stay connected but if you have the network mode set to anything with lte it will drop all connectivity periodically all apns were correct and i even tried some older ones i have  other android phones and all of them maintain connectivity fine with the same sim cardas a result i did not get to properly test the device i processed a return on the first device and then just immediately tested the connectivity on the second device confirming that the issue was the same i returned that one as well sony could probably fix this with a software update if you are on att this is a no go unless you are willing to live with hspa and change some settings,negative

the samsung galaxy s is a fantastic phone but the one i received from this seller was defective i did not find out until after it was activated so this presents a big problem for me the problem is that the it will not charge the battery the first time it charged the battery to  and that is when i had to take it to the att store to get it activated when i returned home i put it back on charge and let it charge for a couple of hours before i returned to get it the phone was not charging and it was  changed i reset the phone and it charged again when it got to  i installed the update i thought the update might fix the charging problem after the update the phone was reset while it finished installing that all went fine i saw that the phone was charging so i left it on the charger and went o sleep when i returned  hours later it had stopped charging and the phone was charged to  so all the problems with the phone have to do with the charging i also tried the finger print scanner as a method to unlock the phone but after it was trained it took way to many tries to get it to read my finger correctly it was a good thing that the phone had a backup password that could bypass the finger print i do not know if i should order another one of these phones i am pretty sure they are refurbished phones but they avoid saying that in the description,negative

the blackphone is a good effort and the hardware itself seems to be quite good in an enterprise environment where security is important and coworkers are also using blackphones and where the enterprise provides support the product would be quite good but if you are simply looking to conduct encrypted communications with one or two persons obtaining blackphones would deserve a lot of thoughtone problem is that the documentation is incomplete another is that customer service is handled only by email and the lag time between asking a question and receiving an answer ranges from a day or two to several days another issue is that your communication is encrypted to the recipient only when both parties are using blackphones otherwise it is only encrypted to the blackphone server in switzerland and not from the server to the recipient,negative

i purchased  apple iphone  phones from ideal expert last month both looked brand newbut clearly looks can be deceivingfrom the start one phone had a problem where the recipient heard a strong echodistortion when speaking which interfered with the conversation when i sent an email through amazon clearly articulating the problem to the company i received a brief response from their team have you tried calling the manufacture for an exchangeconsidering my options i decided to take my phone to an expert to see whether he could solve the problem a couple of seconds after opening the case he told me that the phone was not a new one but refurbished at a glance he could see clear evidence of water damage and it was missing all kinds of screws fastenersetci was horrified to learn this and deeply troubled that ideal expert considers this acceptable practice  particularly given their supposed complete customer satisfaction guarantee we stand behind the quality of our products with an ironclad  guarantee we are in the business of building longterm relationships with our customers and we are confident that you will be satisfied with each and every purchase made from us we offer an exclusive ez nohassle return policy if for any reason you are not satisfied simply send your product back to us for an immediate replacement or refundin my opinion ideal expert has displayed a flagrant disregard of integrity and have manifest very poor business ethics and practice i fail to see how such behaviour can lead to longterm relationships nor to fullysatisfied customersif my experience is anything to go by my strong recommendation to all potential purchasers is buyers bewareupdate shortly after my posting i received an email from the ideal expert team as follows this was bought in august we are now in october and cannot accept a return this is past  days and we will not accept a return i responded to correct their error  reminding them that i had in fact notified their team of the problem well within the time frame and had even received their acknowledgement of that emaili remain deeply concerned that ideal xpert has not only sold defective goods but then chose to use their time period as an excuse for not dealing with the problem i still fail to see how such poor business practices are deemed acceptable by the companyupdate  today the screen of my iphone  went blankwithout any warning nor any good reason the phone is again back with my tech expert to try to resolve,negative

this product was advertised as factory unlocked the first clue something was amiss was that the instruction book was in an eastern european language and not any english translation same was true with the language setting on the tablet when first turned on my research had indicated that it was att compatible after a very vigorous  minute attempt by an att customer service rep and the store manager to go so far as to customize a sim card to fit it would neither fit nor activate on the bright side amazoncoms return process was simple and commendable im satisfied with the outcome although not with the product,negative

i am not much for posting reviews as unless i am truly dissatisfied i think its caveat emptor in this marketplace this phone is a bust it takes literally a count of five or six before it recognizes that you tapped the screen this means that if you have experience with a regular smart phone you have already tapped the screen about  times to make sure it recognizes you the result is that the first tap eventually gets recognized three seconds to change to the new screenwhere your second tap may get recognized for that page it can take  seconds to get to the bottom of that irritating rabbit hole battery charges slow discharges with blazing speed and then when you invariably have to plug it in to the car charger because you just had  and now its about to die this absolutely stupid charging screen takes over the phone meanwhile you have to swipe very assiduously and slowly to the right it will not recognize a  swipe  just snaps right back to get back to a useful screen let us say sending an important message to a client but three letters into the message that  charging screen reappears you have to slowly swipe again only to find that because you swiped on some pointless ad in the screen you are not taken to your message but to the latest game app so what do you do tap the screen to go backbut it does not recognize this for about  seconds so you wind up back in the rabbit holeand by the time you get out and back to the message  yep  it tells you its charging also why the hell would anyone put the charging port at the top of the phone try talking and charging at the same time do not buy,negative
i needed an unlocked sim card phone for a trip to costa rica i read the reviews both positive and negative and decided for short term to just text call and email this phone would be ok it was not ok not even close to ok in addition to all the other negatives from other reviews i will add that the antenna on this phone is really really weak i never could make a phone call because at best i had  bar and the call did not go through i never managed to get a text through but i did get the email to work unfortunately i could only send emails if i was sitting within  feet of the router oh yeah there is the battery life there is not any ok im exaggerating if you do not use it it has a day or two if you forget to turn off wi fi you have got a couple hours,negative

do not buy this phone ill explain you why poorly built the connectors both the audio jack and the usb charging port are poorly built and poorly designed specially the charging port that leaves part of the cable exposed when connected unresponsive slow the system is overall very laggish and unreponsive this is due to the small amount of ram the phone has opening whatsapp or line takes seconds and typing sometimes becomes impossible the system freezes very frequently poor support rcas website has basically no support for this device an email address and two links to pdfs that do not work no downloads no drivers for windows no roms if you want to flash this and install cyanogenmod on this you are out of luck rooting it is extremely complicated camera it may be  mp but it could very well be a s camera the lens is of terrible quality and the pictures are frequently out of focus blurred and with excessive glow the front camera is even worseyou may think well for this price what would you expect actually a much better product the cost of manufacturing this phone is ridiculous since the mediatek chipset used is relatively cheap and all the other components are dirt cheap there are phones out there with the same specs and features for half the price this is a bad android phone for a bad price,negative

this phone is good for basic quick calls or a simple short text pros cheap it works looks decent the construction is fairly sturdy cons not very user friendly has no instruction manual you cannot hear the phone ring even in a fairly quiet room the alarm on its loudest is faint from a short distance the cell reception is very poor with constant dropped calls making it not good for long conversations i would not recommend buying this phone unless you just need it for an emergent situation but even then you will be struggling to get a good signal and your conversation will blip in and out making it hard to for whom ever is listening to understand you,negative

this phone is probably the cheapest phone i have ever seen it is made out of thin plastic and would probably shatter into a million pieces if ever dropped secondly this was not a phone intended for american use the factory preset is to chinese  so good luck finding someone to decipher the symbols in getting the phone to display english words the earbuds that it came with are just as cheesy and hurt your ears i would suggest spending a little more and steering clear away from this mess,negative

i believe i was purchasing a new  not refurbhished item however the phone has been problematic since it was activated after a few months of use it began to power itself down automatically after  to  minutes of use it also did not hold a charge for very long i took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad upon opening the phone to change the battery he discovered a somewhat bloated battery  indicating that it had probably been wet at one time i can attest that the phone has never been dunked he also said that stickers inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one i had never had it serviced before and as said i thought i was buying a new phone when i ordered there was no indication to say it was not anything but new upon notifying the seller that i received a usedrefurbished rather than a new phone i received a canned reply that basically said i had  days from purchase to return the phone  a totally unsatisfactory answer however for  plus tax spent on a new battery the phone now works well i certainly would not buy from this dishonest provider again,negative

a little about myself i used to work in technical support although that is not currently my profession i am able to speak intelligently about technology my experience with this product has been so negative that i thought others would benefit from my feedbackmy decision to purchase this product was made after reading very favorable product reviews my experience using this phone has not even come close to matching the expectations i hadthis phones single greatest downfall is the poor integration of the software that was written for it with the reasonably capable hardware that is the galaxy s platform the software is terribly buggy requiring frequent reboots and causing individual applications to force close the end result is a terrible user experience especially when one needs the phone to just work following are specific issues i have had with this phone i have no reason to believe they are specific only to my individual unit i believe they would be common to this entire product line there is no fm radio i suppose i could have found this out prior to purchasing the phone but i expected that fm radio was part of the standard android specification not so on this phone perhaps the carriers wanted the consumer to use and purchase an internet radio application along with the data that such use would require gps has rarely worked on this phone i have tried many times to use google navigate with this phone with very little success telenav is loaded on the phone but it is a paid app and i refuse to use a paid app when there is a free app that works or should work just as well phone frequently hangs and becomes nonresponsive requiring me to remove the battery and reboot this happens at random intervals sometimes as frequently as once per day phone is filled with bloatware which i suspect is a major part of the problem bloatware refers to programs the carrier or manufacturer wants to push on the enduser in hopes he or she will spend more money and increase profit margins often the bloatware is included to the detriment of basic usabilityafter such a terrible experience i was ready to defect and purchase an iphone because at the end of the day i need a phone that just works however i recently learned that google is selling its newest phone unlocked and without a contract and without the horrible bloatware i described above i will try the pure google experience and for now will attribute the problems i described above to the horrible integration between manufacturer and carrier on the android platform i have ordered the google nexus and intend to update this review after i have some experience using it,negative
got f instead of i the knox is tripped vietnamese is the default language no us charger no thank you,negative
i am disappointed with my purchase through instatechi purchased this phone from instatech sometimes in january to replace the exact same model i previously owned i activated the phone with verizon sometimes in february since the activation there were some annoying issues with this purchased unit  the datetime widget that comes with it normally displayed the minmax temperature based on location  on my previous phone the new phone has a problem where it will not display the correct temperature i can live with that since that is a minor issuewhat is a problem is that this phones display blanks out after a brief use  and with time this is getting worse you could be talking and in the middle of the conversation the phone will turn blank and the touch display will stop working so you will not be able to disconnect the ongoing conversation not view any new incoming calls or even answer a call if there is an incoming phone call during this blanked out phase the screen will reappear randomly after some time but the duration is getting worse and worsei was looking for a similar model to maintain the familiarity of the features between my old and new htc model but obviously it turned out to be a bad idea what is more disappointing is the fact that the phone is proving unreliable within months of my purchase if the vendor wanted to sell this item to the customers looking for it they should have thoroughly tested it to make sure they are not selling a faulty productfinally i checked on amazon today to see if i can return this phone  approx  months since the phone activation  and of course the return window has expired i will be very careful purchasing future items from insta tech,negative

will never buy again worked pretty well for about a month then it stop wanting to charge so i assumed it must have been a short in the charger so i bought another one i noticed it felt like it fit better the original was loose however that one ceased to work so i bought yet another one then i figured out it was the port to the phone i tested the chargers on other devices and they worked fine so i email the customer service department because it was still under warranty i got an email back saying to send them proof of purchase i then called their customer service and was told just to take a screen shot of my order from amazon after completing that step and sending them the necessary info i received an email on how to send the phone back but it also stated that it would take  days for me to get it back im expected to go  days with no phone that has  that is ridiculous also i can only use the bluetooth headphones if i try to use regular headphones they only work for like  minutes then kinda short out again i tried numerous headphones and tried the headphones on other devices the phone is faulty and now is completely dead and will not charge at all i do not recommend,negative

now i can not say much about the phone because i have never received the item or blessed eyes on it now i placed an order with the oem shop on the th of february  today as i am writing this review is the th of march  you do the math this is how long ago i placed my orderfrom i placed my order i have been back and forth with this company the oem shoptrying to resolve this problem these people have gotten my money a month ago and i can not get it back up to now every time i contact them as i do not have a phone number for them i have to do so via emails they send back saying sorry for the inconvenience this company was dishonest from the start i ordered a phone that they knew they did not have in stock and i had to contact them after weeks of wondering where my phone was not having a tracking number to find out from one person that it was on some kinda back order then it was out of stock and when it became available they will ship it i told these people i wanted my money back they still ship the phone the they recalled the phone in mid transit an sent me an email mind you with such a matter i believe phone calls would be best but that has  that is just my opiniontelling me that they will refund my money within hours to my knowledge  means within two days i received this email on the th of march  it is now the th of march  and up to now no one has contact me as to where my money is and when i will be getting it back this is my first time having dealings with this company the oem shop and it has been the worst experienced yet i have googled trying to find other ways in terms of a phone number to contact this business to speak to a manager or someone in charge to no avail but what did come up on my google search is posts and reviews of people who this company the oem shop has done something similar toto end off i would have to say people amazon is great because i have ordered stuff on the same day i ordered from the oem shop and after and guess what i have already gotten my items but i have to say that the oem shop will not be getting any more business from me other customers be aware you do not want to end up with the same problem i hadwith that said i think amazon should have as a policy that persons or business who sell on amazon need to put up more than an email address as contact info for those of us that end up having disputes like this because if you do not call which you cant because there is no number or email the oem shop they wont contact you and tell you what is happen they need to realize people have to work hard for their money and do not wish to see it go down the drain for nothing again amazon is wonderful but the oem shop needs to pull up their socks this is not a nice thing to be doing ,negative

i am sad to write a bad review on this phone because there were many things i liked but what is most important to me is taking good pictures of my kids for this you cannot use the special camera feature that is designed to take better still life pictures for movement you have to keep the camera on regular there is no good way to change camera settings you cannot chose action photo nighttime etc you can choose flash on off or auto the flash doesnt work properly after having this happen to me i saw online it happens to others for pictures inside of my fast moving kids i need to use a flash or the picture is blurry with this phone the flash goes off then turns off prior to the phone actually snapping the picture i tested with and without flash and the picture is brighter without the flash i tried for a few weeks and sadly the final result was just losing out of some great pictures of my young children the other other negative for me for this camera which may be with any camera is by the end of the day the battery would go out i did not use it that much during the day but i also am not on wifi during the day i had hoped the battery would last a full ampm day with intermittent use otherwise i did really like the phone but having to send it back it gets only a  star,negative

the product itself is amazing this phone runs fast with a clear bright screen amazing camera sound and design the size and weight its preferred too and i cannot help but fall in love with this model i bet you are wondering why i rated one star however the reason being is because what i received was only but a shell of what it should have been i did not get a sim card or a warranty booklet that is to be included in the box i also had noticed that the charger port of the phone was unreliably loose due to my past experience with samsung devices i figured that was common and decided to roll with it turns out the phone also takes forever to charge i really hope that that has  that is just my copy of the phone and not an issue with the model itself because a full nights sleep only got it from  and using the phone constantly with the phone light with most of the power saving apps and features only gives me about  hours that has  that is frustrating cause i had just dropped the i phone  cause of my displeasure with the apple software and restrictions and the iphone could take less than an hour to charge fully and could last me a whole dayafter about  nights of having this product the third night i get home from work with this phone under  of battery i shut it off and plug in the charger for about  minutes as i watch a show on my computer so it could charge at its fastest after one episode i checked the phone to see its charge and it would not light up with the fancy battery icon and the led was not on i had realized that the phone was unresponsive did not light up would not show any sign of charge and worst of all would not turn on i tried many methods of trouble shooting to figure out why my new cellular device was not working and none had worked some told me to take out the battery and hold the power button some told me to let it sit on the charger a while i was also recommended to press and hold all the buttons for a certain amount of time and none of it worked i called att to complain and they had convinced me to do a return on this product so when i logged on to amazon i saw my phones battery icon appear and start charging again i figured that i was supposed to leave it on the charger for a lot longer than what the previous website suggested if that has  that is the reason why it came back to life i was literally  seconds away from shipping this back and getting my money back i give it a few more days to stop being unreliable before i demand a full return for this defective device because i am not spending the initial  dollars and what i pay a month for this,negative
phone does not charge properly  especially with included quick charge cable the included cable does not connect at all but an older samsung cable i have will charge the phone if i wiggle it around just so ive only had the device for a week and  days now ive woken up to find that while properly plugged in it did not charge at all overnight i do not recommend refurbished products from this seller for this reason  as it has  it is common knowledge that charge ports fail and should be replaced in refurb devices there has  there is definitely no excuse for the charger being broken as wellsave your money for a different seller or spend more and buy one new,negative
i thought this phone would be great from other peoples ratings and the price it seemed to be a good thing turns out it is not i did not like the way my group mms would pop up as a download and then it would not download for me to open and read the pictures are not  am not bad until you tried to send one it would come out distorted and looked like crap common places where i would get glte service this phone could only give me g or no service it just was not my cup of tea needless to say i sold it to friend for half price even after telling him the bad things about it but he chose to take it anyways i hope he likes it better then i did grrr,negative
this phone is great until about  months of usage the speed of the phone diminishes largely and simple tasks become aggravating and overly tenuous instagram becomes laggy and switching between pages takes literally minutes opening a new tab causes the phone to freeze for  second pressing home takes about  seconds to actually work these problems occur usually on cheap knockoff phones and not what i would expect from huawei to get the phone back to it has  it is original stuff i tried clearing the memory and cache deleting all my apps and using the cleaning apps on the play store these solutions fixed the problem for a day at most and then the phone started misbehaving again the only true solution is to restore the phone which i did alas a few months later the same problems came again come on huawei i expect more from youwhen the phone does work as it has  it is supposed to it has  it is perfect it does not seem like a lite version whatsoever and had i not known i could have easily of mistaken it as a flagship device maybe these problems are what distinguishes this phone from the higher end version but as stated before if these problems were non existent this would be a  phone i wish i could get a refund but it has  it is too late now,negative

warning this is not a usbased phone and samsung advertisements and support do not match this phones features it has  it is not compatible with many of the features you may have expected it to befor example they are currently running a promotion for a  certificate if you buy a samsung galaxy note  and activate samsung pay  but apparently samsung pay is not supported on this phone when i reached out to samsung tech support about it the tech claimed that this particular phone is not eligible and they would not discuss the certificate i even checked the fine print and could not find the details  all of the ads just say that the note  is eligiblemicrosoft office and other apps there are a number of apps on the google play store that are listed as not compatible and cannot be installed including microsoft office  the free microsoft office for android is a staple for mobile devices so seeing that this is not supported is a shockadditionally my experience with samsung tech support were terrible the person over chat was not helpful and told me to call tech support when i called tech support they disconnected me twice at one point they even seemed to connect me to some sort of spam service that was trying to sell me on some things that sounded like a hoax a  certificate for  and a free help ive fallen and i cannot get up type monitor  the only thing i can imagine is that instead of connecting me internally they misdialed after  attempts i still have not talked to a right personso beware that you may not be getting what has  what is advertised and that tech support may not supportive in solving problems samsung is a far cry from apple and amazon support which is always great,negative

let me start by saying the look  feel of the phone was exceptional i thought i had struck gold with this phone but i was new to a android operating system  i own a ipad and love the simplicity of the os and it provided me with a rude awakening of what was in store the owners manual is one sheet of paper and it starts off with the premise that the as delivered configuration of the phone need not be explained or instructions need not be provided hence the phone would only remain on for a few seconds and then promptly shut down being new  to android environment made my situation worse i did reach tech support of my cell carrier who markets this phone hoping for some online assistance the person told me i could clear any settings and put the phone in oem baseline configuration by a simultaneous manipulation of the power key and some other key which i cannot recall doing this did not reboot the phone as promised  but rather caused the screen to rapidly flash on and off  over and over when i asked the tech support was this normal he replied that the phone had a total failure and was now totally useless he implied that this was not the first time that this had occurred with this model of the blu phone such a beautiful phone stuck with such poor user manual,negative

what a crappy piece of sht all the programs just crash all the timetake forever to switch between programs this phone is so slow i was trying to use my bank app to take pictures of checks to deposit and every time i go to take the picture it crashes microsoft health app crashes  time a day i would not recommend this phone to my worst enemy stay far away from this phone it is at a cheap price because it is cheaply constructed,negative
phone is not what i expected from an android phone it is slow  all the people i know who have android phones can use their phone anywhere but i am unable to use mine without connecting to the internet unless there is free wifi available nearby i might as well have my old phone there was supposed to be a screen protector with it but there was not one battery life is about  hours even if i only use it to make one call having to turn it off to preserve the battery defeats the purpose of having a phone difficult to scroll because it will open what you touch printed user manual not included and it has  it is hard to pull it up and have to switch back and forth from the online manual to the problem im trying to resolve since it costs  i guess you get what you pay for guess ill have to chalk it up to learning experience,negative

good guys shipped  devices and they arrived promptly the devices were in a shrink wrapped with all labels as expected what i found odd is plastic packaging inside holding the device was different color one of the batteries was not in plastic and accessories were not packaged samenow to the bad part the devices booted up and i immediately went on to check life timer to find out that each device was used for thousands of hours and devices are likely refurbishedwhen activating the devices on att network att has not recognized the imei numbers although that is possible since the devices were not designated for att and not in the databaseall in all if i would have wanted a refurbished unit i would have ordered one and would have saved  or more per unit,negative

this was truly an exorcise in frustration and a emotional disappointment after trying so hard to make this function it had such a good looking combination of workmanship which after closer usage became just a paperweight the battery would continuously discharge before a half days usage and charging this technical disaster would render the case extremely hot now for the actual purpose i thought this phone would be great on the internet with its specifications of g no way it was an embarrassment to sit at great location with everyone getting a great signal and i am waiting for anything to load up at best i would have to load the sites in advance before going out and hope this might work nothing happening the camera was also part of the poor quality this cellular phone could give another waste save your money and do not waste your time with this product what a damn shame it looked great on paper with all its hype and photographs guess i was just another sucker taken in by the marketing scheme this company advertised,negative

item listed as new and sold by jet set market and fulfilled by amazon item arrived in an att box as expected however the phone itself is far from new i am dissapointed that amazon just chooses to do business with anyone i choose this particular seller though the order was fulfilled by amazon thinking that if anything it must be a good seller if amazon fulfills their orders there is a sticker on the outside of the att box that lists imei number serial number etc i noticed right out of the box that the phone had visual damage to the front speaker part that is at the very top part of the phone it it bent next i turned the phone over and saw that the labelcover that is screwed on to the inside of the phone the labels containing the imei number serial number etc where you insert your battery was coming undone up close you can clearly see that the cover has been tamered with and see that the inside screws have been unscrewed before now granted the phone is unlocked so i am fully aware that the seller had to insert a battery power the phone up in order to unlock the phone but there is no need to remove the internal battery cover that is the battery cover on the inside of the phone not the outside battery lidcover unless someone replaced a part on the inside of the phone as per another buyers review who had contacted htc for a warranty issue and then discovered that his phone had an imei number that had already been registed i called htc to check on the phone i had infront of me when i noticed that the phone i orderd has a serial number on the inside of the phone that is different than the one listed on the box the box label and the phone label have the same imei number but the serial numbers are different the htc rep told me that this can be due to the fact that the motherboard of the phone could have been replaced in such cases they use the same imei number but serial number can change in anycase not only is the phone visible damaged on the front speaker but also tampered with in the inside as well as serial numbers not matching i contacted amazon who issued a refund immediately and send me a prepaid return label needless to say they offered to send me a new phone however just a few days after ordering my phone which was sold by jet set markets also listed as samina ladha today amazon is fulfulling the order sold by ross cellular ross cellular was the seller who sold the phone with an already registered imei number to the other buyer i read a review by i decided to take my refund and shop elsewhere i am dissapointed in the sellers amazon chooses to do business with but thankful that they refunded me promptlyupdate     i kept my eyes on this listing and i noticed in the span of only a couple of days amazon changes their sellers that they fulfill their orders from their computer system must randomly pick sellers they have an agreement with exact same phone and listing but new sellers every other day having said that my experience is based on the seller jet set markets also comes up under name samina ladha as a buyer who reads a negative reviewexperience look for the name of the seller if listed in the review as this will make a big difference in your buying experience there are plenty of reviews on this site from happy customers i just wish they would have listed who they actually bought from i based my own buying decision on the positive reviews thinking it was the same seller as listed in the advertisement only to discover they change every so often my advise read through the reivews especially the negative ones and see if a sellers name is listed and stay clear from that particular seller if another seller is listed under the phone you are buying that day then make your decisions accordingly good luckif amazon approves i uploaded two photograph of the phone to go with my reivew look under customer pictures above,negative

contrary to what i was led to believe this samsung galaxy s smga gsm unlocked cellphone is not warranted by samsung if purchased through amazon further if a repair is required samsung will lock the phone for use on att onlybefore i bought the phone i contacted the amazon seller mobile hotspot for warranty information they referred me to amazon who referred me to the manufacturer the manufacturers website states that this model is covered by a oneyear manufacturers warranty i then ordered it from amazon when it stopped working about two weeks after i received it i contacted samsung for a warranty repair samsung refused to honor the warranty after many contacts by online chat telephone and email i finally escalated the contact to a manager i learned that the samsung warranty does not apply to units purchased through amazoncom according to the samsung manager amazon is not an authorized samsung dealer it does not print the imei and serial number on the invoice an invoice from an authorized dealer that shows the date of purchase and identifies the phone with the imei and serial number is required to receive warranty service the manager agreed to offer a repair as a onetime only customer courtesy however if they make the repair my unlocked phone will be returned to me no longer unlocked but locked to enable use on att only i do not have an att account so the phone would be useless to me even if it is repairedthis phone may or may not be a good phone when it is working but i did not have it long enough to find out it is now on its way back to amazon along with the various accessories i also purchased i will look elsewhere for an unlocked gsm android phone,negative

phone was delivered sept   when purchasing anything on amazon my personal policy is to extensively research the reviews and especially the one star reviews if the  stars are less than  i make the purchase as long as there are no feature related negatives that turn me off the hardware negativesfailures for this phone were like most cell phones and as such i gave it a shot since the  stars were at around  let us face it mass produced electronics will have bad apples from all manufacturers with that being said ive gotten less than  days of reliable performance from this phone it has  it is been  months and  days and the phone has been excellent up until a few days ago like a large majority of the negatives this phone is now suffering the same fate the screen goes bat sht crazy out of the blue opening apps randomly as if it has  it is been possessed by a demon at this late date i figure it has  it is entirely possible so i downloaded a number of anti malware virus trojan root programs from google play store to try and make sure it wasnt exclusively software os related phone is clean did a hard reset etc removed all apps still fing up one thing i have noticed is the phone has had the tendency to run really hot lately heat  death for cpus even low cycle high tolerance phone cpus which have zero external cooling capabilities are vulnerable if maxed by default which this one is and once a cpu cooks it can begin to produce all kinds of software related issues which appear to be only software related iecrazy screen locking up rebooting etc and the reality is these issues are os related but only in the sense that the ram cannot accurately process cooked data sothe phone freaks unfortunately once a cpu has been heated past its safe thermal threshold for an extended period of time the device is on borrowed time at best or just refuses to function correctly and is rendered a paperweight at worst right now this phone is being shelved as an emergency back up it still functions most of the time which for me is unacceptable this is what happens when a manufacturer pushes the performance limit for their hardware and has less than meticulous quality control at the lenova factory level soform factorappearanceweight  bfeatures and initial impression  amaterials quality and construction  d  my purchaseshort term reliability  days  d long term reliability  do not make me laugh,negative

now my dad used to own a razr before it was such an amazing phone back in its time and i would like to believe that the razr design is still greatso because i have used a razr from motorola before let me warn you that this product is not a razr in terms of qualityin the amazon handson review they talk about a metal body this products body is made out of a cheap plastic i would go so far as to say that the motorola wg that i use for tracfone and only paid  for has more durable plastic than this product also the hinge mechanism felt really flimsy much like the plastic body of this product when taking off the protective plastic film which is used almost everywhere off the phone i noticed that the film protecting the top speaker above the screen moved slightly in theory i could easily break out the top speaker cover easily with enough proddingi was not able to test calling as the sim card was meant for overseas use however the onboard software seemed capable if not dated camera seemed to be working fine and took a few test pictures product read messages and contacts from the sim card as expectedwhile i was sorely disappointed that the hardware was lacking so long as it worked as expected i may have been able to overlook the hardware not being up to standards fortunately this thing died on the rd day the battery refused to hold a charge and the phone would not be turned on even while plugged in even though it was working while plugged in on the first day when trying to turn it on the keypad glows blue as expected but then it simply turns off when plugged in it shows the charging screen as expected but there are white lines on the bottom of the screen which did not show when it was first working or charginghonestly i am sorta relieved that it broke down now rather than later when i had the product in my hand i was so confused as it looked like the razr of old but it did not feel like one the fact that the plastic body did not feel solid made me a bit on edge as to how long this phone would have lasted overseas i felt so embarrassed that this phone was a gift because it simply was not what i was expecting when i bought this i expected a razr a solid phone that has worked in the past but what i received feels like some cheap knock off product that just uses the same designreturned the product which only gave disappointment and wasted my time,negative

the device shipped quickly and arrived fine however nowhere on this items title or descriptions is mentioned by the seller that this is the international version of the phone after using it for one day and not getting any of my text messages as well as being unable to call even though i could access the mobile data network with my old sim i contacted my carrier as my carrier explained and you can read online in various locations it is very likely the cell bands for lte or g will not be covered by north american carriers my carrier was also perplexed how i could even access the mobile data network without being able to make phone callstext and having wifi disabled again my only complaint is that nowhere is it explicitly stated on this items page that it may not work properly in north america under north american carriers or bother to use the words international versionif you are a north american mobile phone carrier subscriber you should not buy this phone unless you check what bands your service provider uses even then the bands vary wildly in locations that they are offered so you may not be able to use it at all,negative

i researched this product and looked forward to receiving it i even paid a fee for fast delivery however the seller surgetelecom sent the same model number but with an l at the end of the model number the l means the telephone is configured for latin america and it is not the telephone i ordered i tried to use the phone in the us but its speed never went over edge or h because the phone is not configured for the useven though the phone i received has the same model number as this phone except for the l at the end the l model phone is quite different as i wrote it is configured for latin america the box the telephone came in showed that the phone was manufactured in vietnam and most of the writing on the box is in spanish worse however is the fact that the phone with the l requires a mini sim card while this model requires a standard sim that makes a huge differencei will be ordering again and hopefully a different seller will not substitute my order with a phone that is configured for a totally different geographic areaa friend has this phone the one i ordered but not the wrong one i received from the seller surgetelecom the phone is great and is perfect for my needsupdate i returned the wrong phone that i received discussed above i then ordered a replacement phone and incredibly i received another phone with the l after the model number and the wrong size sim card this makes two separate times i received the wrong phone within one month be careful when ordering even though the model number you receive is correct if the model number has an l after it the phone will not work properly in the usdoes not anyone bother to check items before they are shipped,negative

let me start by saying the look  feel of the phone was exceptional i thought i had struck gold with this phone but i was new to a android operating system  i own a ipad and love the simplicity of the os and it provided me with a rude awakening of what was in store the owners manual is one sheet of paper and it starts off with the premise that the as delivered configuration of the phone need not be explained or instructions need not be provided hence the phone would only remain on for a few seconds and then promptly shut down being new  to android environment made my situation worse i did reach tech support of my cell carrier who markets this phone hoping for some online assistance the person told me i could clear any settings and put the phone in oem baseline configuration by a simultaneous manipulation of the power key and some other key which i cannot recall doing this did not reboot the phone as promised  but rather caused the screen to rapidly flash on and off  over and over when i asked the tech support was this normal he replied that the phone had a total failure and was now totally useless he implied that this was not the first time that this had occurred with this model of the blu phone such a beautiful phone stuck with such poor user manual,negative

several design flaws make this pretty miserable to use ifwhen the screen touches your face while you are on a call the phone will hang up the button to turn updown the volume is directly across from a button that will lock the screen so you hold that button at the same time if you are using one hand which is the natural way to do it to wake up your screen before then swiping to unlock you have to hold down a button for several seconds which will definitely become annoying have to slide the phone open to use the inside key pad while checking my voicemail messages screen buttons for sending text messages make it very easy to send a message before you are readyseems that this phone was not texted at all before being put on the market,negative

i have spent too long trying to make this phone work and now i cannot return it so it sits here and stares at me and says dummy i have tried three different active sim cards in this phone and it simply refuses to work it spends all of its time trying to upgrade itself or shuts itself off or just jumps from screen to screen by itself the only way to stop it when it does this is to take out the battery i cannot get it to stay on one screen long enough to do a factory reset from the settingsi do not fault amazon or the company that sold the phone maybe they have had good luck all i can say is if you get an unknown then insure it is working and stable before the return period expires,negative

if i could give this phone and the company a zero i would the phone has many glitches you get what you pay for i have called the support team to get my issues fixed and nothing worked so the next step is to set up a warranty claim you have to send your phone in and they have  weeks to either fix your issue or send you a refurbished phone this whole time you have to find a replacement phone on your own or be screwed out of one so if you do decide to purchase this piece of crap get the separate insurance blu might as well not offer a one year warranty because it is useless,negative

pretty poorly thought out and executed there has  there is a slot for your id to slide into on the inside of the door the prongs that hold it are about mm too small does not seem like a big deal but it makes the id card bend the bulge makes it impossible to really fit more than  cards without it pushing the edges out the phone out the front of the case lose lose for me as i like to carry my debit and credit and id another issue with the doorslot is that when you open the door the edge of the card catches the edge of the soft rubbery card compartment it makes the door close or makes a loud click finally the door does not open to  degrees they claim it is to use as a kickstand but it has  it is pretty flimsy and not opening all the way makes it difficult to get cards out,negative
i have been holding off for a while on reviewing this phone now after using it for a while i hate it i like the colors and the larger screen but that is it it is even slower than my old  moto g i have minimized my apps to the essentials and moved all possible ones to my sd card but it is still extremely slow and unresponsive it has not updated to the latest version the extra camera is a joke moving objects are not only blurry but they have ghosts i have a task killer and hibernator and cleaner apps to no avail it has been a battery vampire straight out of the box do not get this phone seriously and i am  day too late to return it sigh,negative

the phone itself is a great value it works well especially given the price there seems to be an issue with this model whereby the phone can get into an endless reboot cycle the support team indicated to me that this is a known issue which a number of people have encountered when i attempted to get my phone repaired under warranty lg told me that the standard turnaround time is  days that seems like an unreasonable amount of time for to be without a phonecontrast this experience with a mobile provider which typically can send out a replacement within a day as a warranty repairrecommendation if you want this phone buy it from your carrier or through google it might cost a bit more but consider what the cost of not having a phone for nearly  weeks might be,negative

for the price it is great there are issues but i still consider this a good buy for what i use it for i have an htc one m google play edition which sucks flat out no support bugs everywhere that stopped working after android  came out on an ota so i switched to the vivo ivproscamerascreenweightfeelgeneral speed and fluidity with appsbattery life i keep bluetooth gps locations and wifi off unless i am actually using it so my battery life is on par with the htc one m i have for the most partcons the stock launcher and user interface is crap should have just thrown on stock android and included a card or paper in the package with recommended launchers with qr codes or something the stock messaging app is terrible and the phone does not like to switch to another one even with the proper settings and defaults selected again issues from the blu customized osinterfaceedit this has gotten even worse i can barely text i have had issues get worse and worse with the messaging situation the stock messaging app does not work with mms well at all and i cannot have group texts like i do on gosms handcent or textra the gps is crap the cell radio is subpar but works fine for texting and calling it will lose signal if you look at it wrong though pretty weak and unreliable if you are in a well insulated or large building does not have lte but it is not an issue for me because regular g and wifi are more than i use bandwidthwise the vibration thing for tapping and texting randomly goes out for a bit stop vibrating mid text though nothing else messes up i can still type it has  it is just not accompanied with the vibration and then resumes randomly edit after owning this phone for a bit it has just gotten worse the wifi radio is absolutely unreliable and the os and it together are basically giving me a  mp player and calculator if i can connect to any wireless network it will work fine but after a couple of months it has started to glitch very badly when turning the wifi radio on or off  of the time now it does not work it will just stay on until i reboot or not turn on until i reboot and it keeps randomly not being able to properly access or even acknowledge saved networks edit the on screen keyboard is terrible i have not tried using another keyboard app but the stock one is trash edit the stock launcher this seems to be a trend with stock forcefully overriding anything you do at random keeps interfering with my third party one sometimes you can actually use the launcher you have installed and set as defaulti might just be a magnet for unreliable lemons of phones but this is so frustrating and buggy that i cannot even use it most of the time now i cannot text i cannot use wifi i cannot actually choose default apps that stick after some time with it the only thing that actually works all of the time is the camera and the alarm clock try to find a different phone,negative

this is actually my first time to write a review but i just felt that i had to so please forgive me if im the one in the wrong herethough i would definitely fall in love with the s if everything that should work is actually working then there should be no problem at all but like life not everything goes as you had  you would expect it tofor my case i had already bought this phone here twice and planning to return it once again to possibly either try again or find a different sellerphone this is for the reason that upon receiving the product and then setting it up for the first time i then proceeded to check the cover if it has  it is sealed properly so that i could then try to dunk it on a glass of water so that i would know whether the phones water shielding works for both the first and second times the phones abruptly showed a set of static colored lines then proceeded to shut itself down after  or more seconds for the first phone i think i heard circuits being fried before i remembered to immediately remove the battery which was a pretty depressing thing to mein the end i do not know if it has  it is my luckmy last amazon order had to be returned twice because the first was a different product then the second had a very noticeable defect having to receive two defective phones in a row or the phones here are actually defective underwater either way ill have to return it and choose whether i should stay and persevere or give up and choose something new,negative

see update belowive been using this phone for over  weeks now and i so glad i went with the zchardwareit heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings but not all too concerningespecially considering i do not notice any heat during typical daily operation i would say the battery is adequate but it would not be considered one of the strengths of this phone i do not imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go biggerwhich why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that go with the xperia z that said i have not experimented too much with stamina mode but if you use alternate messaging services  apps like google voice or music streaming apps you shall  you will have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is offwhich will diminish the benefit of stamina mode and preclude you from using ultra stamina mode all together this is my first quick charge  device and im very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while ie  minutes wireless charging would have been nice to have but ill gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers expandable memory and water resistancespeaking of expandable memory my buddy was playing with a cameraequipped drone his girlfriend got him for christmas and was bummed he could not get the videos off the micro sd card he did not have an adapter everyone at the party iphone users was blown away at how i was able to get and share the video by putting the micro sd card in my phone and using google drive to share it i do not know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memoryat p screen resolution  quality looks great to me if reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching hd fulllength movies on your phone get a bigger phone i have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching youtube videos or reading articlesi do not take a lot of photos  videos but im pleased with the camera so far you can find great camera comparisons online from what i found this camera is great but samsungs perform better in lowlight and close up focusingbut the zc is a huge step up from my htc one m when it comes to low light picturessoftwarei was a big fan of htcs sense ui and did not know how id like sonys ui as this is my first smartphone from them after downloading an htclike free clock  weather widget i like the ui a lot screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun still waiting for android  marshmallow update that was promised see summary belowsummaryas far as i know the perfect phone does not exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for waterresistance expandable memory and front facing speakersi was prepared to give this phone a perfect  stars im giving it  however because it would appear that sony is following the lead of others by promising soon updates to the latest android version  marshmallow to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed if the update comes prior to the new year ill adjust my review to  stars almost  months for an update seems like enough time to tailor marshmallow to their uiif it was a priorityupdatethis is the worst phone ive ever had on paper it has  it is great but ive never been so frustrated with lagging issue ill get a phone call while its in my hand and ill mis the call because pushing answer is nonresponsive killing apps helps a bit but i find myself restarting the phone a lot i was hoping the marshmellow update would help but its now march th  still no update first  last time i buy a sony phone since the galaxy s is water resistant with expandable memory i think ill get it if a softwarw update comes soon  fixes my problems,negative

update i am not blaming the vendor but i did purchase an internally damaged phone from cellular trendzover a year ago i bought a white iphone c on here from wesellcellular and the phone was great and at a great price i needed another cheap c so i got a green one from cellular trendz everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone i am tech savvy and ive done numerous iphone repairs myself so i bought a reputable battery here on amazon i opened the phone and i noticed one of the water damage indicators was red red water damaged white  never been exposed to water i checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red one of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing but it gets worse there are rice grains inside the phone not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone this leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone removed the battery and stuck it in ricegood for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iphone while on a budget however with the latest ios  update this phone is slower than ever try and get one with ios  or prior but for longterm use i would go for a newer model,negative

i am not happy with this item but i am continuing to hope i can get it working i was aware of the limitations in terms of speed however there seem to be a multitude of other problems to start with the sos feature cannot be configured i logged onto geos as instructed and received a code  the code must be entered into the unit to enable the sos feature  guess what the software does not allow you to enter it anywhere the web browser feature does not not work and there are two conflicting sets of instructions one says to use the safari browser the other says to use opera mini  neither works on the iphone the connect button works but it disabled on the ipad neither twitter access method works  a twitter pin is required but twitter will not provide those to us residents the mail function can send email via gmail but seems unable to receive any email from gmail in addition the unit is unable to hold a sat link for more than  or  minutes  even in open flat ground no link can be made at all while moving i have ordered aux antenna to see if that helps the phone appears to work  but i doubt a signal lock can be held for more than a minute or two iridium and geos provide zero support and the online documents and app help are a joke the user is on their own to figure it out the unit appears well built and durable but it is nothing more than an overpriced paperwieght i am going to continue to slog forward with this device because i have heard some good things  but a return is very likelywith help from blue cosmo i was able to get the sos feature working they have provided support on the other issues which i am working through i will update once i have followed through all their advicesecond update i am in northern california and have tried to use these device extensively around california and nevada it has never worked blue cosmo has not responded to my request for an rma i document via photos trying to use the device in the desert at kelso with  bars and an external antenna no internet no cell phone no weather forecasts and no sms i asked for an rma after that test in january and blue cosmo has just ignored me iridium is a reputable company but this device is a dog and there is no support do not buy it i am out over  for a boat anchor and i am not happy about,negative

i initially was really pleased with this phone setup was a snap and the phone was fully functionalhowever what i found was that it had stability issues it would often freeze running an app or unexpectedly restart the os when it froze i would have to pull the battery to recover usually i had the problem at least once every day or two but sometime several times in a right in a row it would crash i installed the gas buddy app after the first week and found that using that app would consistently crash the phone being my first android phone i asked other android users about stability and found their phones ran for weeks or months wo issuesi found a firmware update on tmobile site that was supposed to address stability issues and was able to load it android version   software tuvle manually using the samsung kies tool ota update was no longer available from tmob however it did not resolve the problem after two weeks i returned this phone after seeing a lot of similar issues reported on the online forum too bad i really liked the phone other than the stability problemsi replaced it with a samsung blaze g and although i have only had it for a day i have not been able to crash it even with the same gas buddy app that always crashed the exibit the blaze also has a dual core ghz processor versus the single core ghz processor of the exhibit and twice the ram of the exhibit i did not think the exhibit was particularly slow but the blaze is much faster on everything and noticeably more responsive running a very similar build of android  compared to the exhibit,negative

warning do not buy i have had nothing but negative experiences with this product let me explain after loading the  euro gb card onto the device i started trying to connect with our wifi instructions that were included with the product said it might take  minutes to connect the first time fine no problem but when it did not connect after  minutes i emailed gloclame hoping to get some help they never responded the site says that they will respond within  hours but it has been  days and no response customer service seems to be nonexistent since the device did not actually have a full charge i thought maybe that was the problem so while the device was looking for our wifi i hooked it up to the computer to finish charging it about an hour later i checked on it well it had finally found our wifi and had connected but to my surprise and horror  gb of data had already been used up i could not believe what i was seeing apparently this device gobbles up data whether you are using it for texts and calls or not i have not even made my trip to europe yet and my data is half gone imagine if i were in an emergency situation in france and needed to use my phone then found that the wifi data was completely gone and i had not even had the chance to text or made a phone call yet there is not a off button you have to hold the power button for  seconds to turn it off or on but there is no way of knowing if the device is truly off or on you might think it is off and all the time it is eating up your data on the sly adding to my disappointment i found that the unit comes with a card that says get  euros top up credit for free but when you open the card you have to write a  star customerfeedback review in order to get the free credit that probably explains why there are several  star reviews ethical i do not think so so there you have it thankfully i was able to return the item to amazon so grateful to amazon and their return policy,negative

this phone only lasted  months maybe only a few weeks after receiving it it started having charging issues it would not hold a charge and took forever to charge up eventually it stopped charging completely and would not turn on anymore also when i uploaded it to my verizon account and activated it it came up as an amber brown phone despite being white so when i had to get it replaced by insurance both verizon and asurion would not replace it with a white phone because the code in the phone is for an amber brown one do not order from this seller,negative

i was hoping this phone would go at least six months but for no reason it started turning on and off by itself until it finally stopped turning on do not know if its a new phone i got or if its the brand but i would never ever recommend buying the phone or from the seller everwb,negative
the phone would be fine if it were new or even used but in good condition but instead they sent me what looked like a new phone but was obviously a rebuild of poor quality with tons of problems bought this off amazon and after having it a couple of weeks i finally used the headset plugin so i could listen to calls with earphones nope doesnt work the connector where you plug your headphones in is clearly defective  likely broken away from the cell phones motherboard and so it doesnt work several of the buttons stick too but they work ok pretty much a rip off i think with these rebuilds or actually i think this one was even advertised as new you get the luck of the draw some are going to work well and some do not mine does not i lost out this time so just check out your entire phone very closely before you toss the packaging and before the timeframe in which returns are allowed expires and you might be okassuming they handle returns well i wouldnt know since i didnt discover the major problems until it was too late my true advice is to not buy these cheaply priced phones on amazon where the deal is to good to be true if it sounds too good to be true the phone you get will likely have problemsif the phone were new it would have its own flaw or two mainly the outside screen is so smallit has  it is worthless you really cannot use teh outside screen so just consider it as if you only have the inside screen think of it that way and the phone if it didnt have the used problems above would be fine,negative

the device arrived the same day than other products despite the extra  for the two day shipping it was late if we consider that was expected after two labor days it was a waste to have two shipping daysthe device itself is great i had the old vibrant sg from tmobile but just broke its screen this gsmini is just a little bit bigger but best replacement i do not like the super sized s the model is the gti from somewhere in europe france it comes with a brochure from the mobile company orange after charged i turned it on and asked me the preferred language data for account logins and internet created some accounts as well and finally was up and running fine the charger has a plug useful in some countries in europe and many other countries in latam etc the seller included an adapter for the us connector the box itself appeared unopened with its seal intact but a more careful look showed that the seal was on top of a previously broken seal both seems to be official but who knows how hard can be to make a sticker with the words samsung on it the device had plenty of plastics protecting all the sides and corners so it looks enough new to methe cons horrible boot screen no idea how to replace it without rooting the phone many not needed applications you cannot uninstall unless rooting the device as most smartphones it uses microsim cards no idea why since it has plenty of space for the regular sim cards i had to buy a cutter to trim my old sim the device comes with android  i was expecting something more recent at least  or an update but no its price feels way too high for a device with only gb of internal memory already shared with os and the several updates to its original appsi recommend the product but knowing in advance its detailsedit be aware that as with previous model samsung messed it up firmware  allows to move apps to sd to free internal memory space but it is not true all it does is to say it did it but it only moves the apps to a sort of partition or folder emulate on the same internal memory checked many forum and this issue is reported since s iii but is still not solved by samsungsome stated that firmware  may solve it but my kies still says  is the latest firmwarethis is a huge fault on this device my previous sg vibrant really moved the apps to the sd as most android devices it is one of the plus over iphones but this one more modern and very expensive device just fakes it do not get confused by samsung support faq stating this is only due to developpers of some apps not using sd compatibility because no one app was in fact moved to the sd card all went to the emulated area inside the internal memory despite stating the app was moved to sd i even checked my sd card on linux to see all hidden forldes and nada no one app was moved there not even a folder was created to do so google this issue and you will find many forums showing this problemi do not like when manufacturers lie and sellers do nothing to inform their customers about what the product really is this bug is known since long time and the seller should know the products they sell when i press move to sd and it says it did it i expect to find it on the sd card too much to askmy internal memory is getting full by just having builtin apps autoupdatedi am overseas now otherwise i would ask for a full refundno i do not recommend this product until samsung offers a firmware update that solves this issue,negative

sometimes the phone hangs while receiving or ending calls and then shuts down for a long long long time it has to have specific head phones that only work with windows os and when you go buy head phones at stores obviously the sales person will not let us pop up the packaging to try out and find out that it works on this phone so ended up buying couple of them and none of them worked but it does not say anywhere that this will require specific head sets and the universal ones do not work anywhere here,negative
use this phone for  days and then returned it had to restart several times a day charge twice a day no good,negative
if i could give this  stars i would i was so hyped for this phone did all my research and read the reviews i was as prepared for a purchase as one could bei got the phone in my hot little hands and it was beautiful matched the pic powered on updated nicely ran smoothly on first start up then i loaded up with games messenger facebook etc the normal things i would use a phone forthis is where the nightmare began day one of moderate use texting calls playing a few games on it while on lunch by the end of my shift the phone was dead literally dead in my pocketi thought maybe i turned it off by accident i tried to start it and nope it was totally dead yes it does have quick charge and charges from dead to full in about an hour but when you are out and about and not thinking about charging your phone it is not convenient i needed a phone that would take me through a busy day without me having to worry about finding a way to charge it for an hourthe phone i purchased this to replace was a huawei ascend a  year old phone running android  which would last me a day easy without much trying this nexus x i have to baby to make it through a day which is not what i want to be doing with a  high end phonemy wifes blue vivo lasts a full day seems to be better built has  sim slots and expandable memoryto say i am disappointed is an understatement returning the phone as quickly as possible and hopefully the next phone i purchase will be better than this,negative

i wish i had less than one stars to choose while i really appreciate amazons customer service this product is not worth trying i purchased two of these sets a couple of months apart the first one worked for about two to three months and then just died i called amazon customer service and was sent a replacement the same day received the set in the evening so i will give amazon  star for its customer service the other set is with my sister overseas and within one month of using she started complaining about a couple of things  the phone would not charge fully  the back side of the phone around the camera would get extremely hot i wish the set were here and i would have just returned it in a nut shell this phone is economical with a good camera quality but i would not recommend this due to unreliability from my experience,negative
i had purchased the samsung s from shopbest on may   within one month after my purchase the phone had a software issue and i was unable to use it during my travel outside us i had high expectation when i purchased this product but it turned out to be a piece of lemon,negative
after living with this phone for a month the only good thing i can say about it is that it looks gorgeous it is small enough to hold in your hand yet you can easily see the display without squinting however everything else goes downhill from therefirst off let us talk about the hardware the phone looked good when i took it out of the case but as soon as i put it into my pocket it got scratched by my drivers liscence no you read this correctly a small plastic card managed to scratch the screen okay i though i will just be more carefull and buy a case and never keep anything else in the same pocketnext lets talk about the battery life if you do not use your phone for any light web browsing just simple text and calls throughout the day you will get about  hours of battery life if you do say hello to a dead phone within the next  to  hours even with the stamina mode battery life is nothing to be happy aboutlet us move on to the operating system the keyboard provided by the oem is junk the same goes for all the applications provided by sony you end up hitting the wrong key everytime and it will autocorrect without your permission sometimes it will even stay on the screen even after you closed the application that was using it this is important to consider because for some reason sony thought that they had to dictate you to use every application you cannot delete any of them although you can use another one in its place this is important to consider because this phone does not come with an minisd card slot hence you will only have about  gb of memory available to begin withhowever the fun does not begin until you install the lastest version of android available for your phone jelly bean will really give you headache as soon as i downloaded it my phone began to shut itself off randomly about  times a day i would have my default applications and widgets switched with the oem applications my phone would make random phone calls or delay sending and recieving text messages until the next days it would also reload things that i had deleted or removed from my phoneall in all this phone was a nightmare it was a mistake i am left with a  dollar brick that has a mind of its own i actually had to dig up my brothers old blackberry because of how many things went wrong with this phone the worst being a  dollar data overage fee from my service provider because of it downloaded updates even after i had the settings for data usage turned off stay away from this phone or be prepared to root it that is the only way to get a smooth experience because it has way too many bugs for the record i did root it but i still have a terrible battery life and a ton of scratches,negative

this is a flaky device after struggling with the gb version of the blu phone i ordered this one assuming the gb internal storage would rectify the problems i faced with the gb version to a certain extent it did but new more difficult problems arosethe biggest problem is how this phone utilizes the external sd storage that is to say not very well at all there is a setting to have the sd card the default storage medium for all downloads and new apps this setting is always ignored no matter what the phone will download everything to internal storage ive tried multiple wipes and reboots no matter what when i download something it goes to internal storageso after moving everything over to external storage manually i noticed that upon reboots my user interface was missing multiple app icons the apps were still on my phone but apparently during the reboot the os did not recognize the location of the apps external sd storage so it just deleted them from my ui i would simply pin the app back in it has  it is spot but it was frustratingthen apps started getting deleted randomly in their place there was an android icon with a text string describing the machine code name for the app something like androidcmyelpcom or some other gibberish i do not remember but when i clicked on that it simply gave me an error message even more difficult when i try and uninstall this remnant of these apps the phone just rebootsim returning this one and switching to something other than blu after two failures with two different phones they just are not  am not ready for anyone who wants to have a decent amount of storage their handling of external sd cards is simply a wreck  nonfunctionalif you can live with gb of internal storage and have no desire for any additional sd card usage this might work for you otherwise avoid,negative

this was without a doubt one of the worst purchases i have ever made i understand that i bought a used phone but it was described as being in good condition if good condition means a battery that will not charge properly has never fully charged and it actually loses power when plugged in at times a time setting that changes at random my alarm was set for  am so i could get some sleep before my final exam the phone changed time zones and i was woken up at  am the apps i downloaded suddenly disappear the casing was falling off the plug that was sent along with the phone to recharge it has cable exposed and the phone shuts off at random oftenwhat is worst is that the seller is completely unprofessional and unhelpful i have written so many emails to this person asking for them to help resolve the problem all the replies i have gotten have been late and really unhelpful the seller would not even write his name after he replied although the phone itself is clearly messed up he asked me to send it back so i could get the replacement i asked for this was really fishy so i asked him to please send a replacement battery instead as i did not trust the situation i never got the battery the situation had already been dragging on for weeks and i hardly heard back from him so i wrote a negative review he asked me to take this off of amazon and promised to send a replacement i agreed did i ever get the phone no and i do not expect i willdo not waste your time and money with this company if you are going to make an investment in a product like this at least make sure you are dealing with more reliable people who actually care about customer satisfaction,negative
i did lots of research before purchasing this phone and i was pleased with the bang for the buck when the phone arrived then i noticed that the android market was missing the ability to add apps was my number one reason for selecting an android phone im pretty tech savvy and i invested a few hours looking into resolving the problem on my own but found no easy way like other reviewers with the same issue i had the arabic versionin summary i recommend the phone if you are looking for a low cost entry level smartphone yes the resolution is poor but it has  it is ok given the price tag yes the phone can be sluggish at times but it has  it is not excessive and i could easily live with it however if you do decide on this phone i highly recommend asking the seller if it has  it is the arabic version and if the android market app is installedalso keep in mind that the wildfire s will be coming out shortly and will have a slightly better processor and screen resolution of course it will also be more expensive,negative

so after long deliberation about my first smartphone i chose the sony xperia m aqua i have had sony ericsson phones before that were very sturdy so i was hoping for something similar my husband trusted my judgement and also needed a new phone so we ended up ordering two we have had them for seven weeks nowfrankly i am very disappointed if i have one word to describe this phone it would be slow i did not install that much apps or anything but when switching on the phone it just takes a long time also when opening social media apps like whatsapp or facebook it just keeps switching off and on while you are typing extremely annoying taking a picture of something that is not a still object is practically impossible it takes  sec to take the shot which is a very very long time so you end up always missing that one moment and when you take the picture after a few seconds you see a frame being saved but this is not the picture you end up with so blurry pictures are now a big part of my library unfortunatelyeven worse with the video recording  without any sign that something is wrong they can end up completely black i was taping two of our friends saying i do at their wedding and afterwards it turned out there was absolutely nothing on the tape you did see that something was taped though and i could play it but as said it is completely black next video i tried turned out fine  no idea why but again i missed the big moment because of the phonewhen someone calls and you just touch the screen somewhere to pick up the phone you are disconnected most of the timesmy husbands phone stopped working after five weeks of light use  microphone did not work in  out of  times he had to ship it to be looked at and has to miss his phone  business days without any replacement this is completely unacceptable for a brand new phone he should just get a new one if you ask mealso be careful when placing the phone in your pocket because the back tends to become really really hot almost too hot to touch at one point can not be healthy to walk around with close to your bodyand the last thing i do not like is the fact that it is too big for my hands but that has  that is just because i have rather small handswhat do i like  i like the design i like the fact that it has  it is water proof however did not put this to the test yet i like the the ringtones i definitely like the battery life two days easily takes at least  hours to recharge thoughbut i would not recommend it to anyoneupdate in looking for a solution for the videos always turning out black  i found that this is an issue that is often reported and well know to sony their only solution is to restart the phone then  or  videos can turn out ok,negative
the alarm does not work the phone heats up so much after five minutes of conversation that it has  it is hard to hold the sound quality is very low and there is no volume adjustment the battery started running out in two days with basically one hour talking time per day im not sure but maybe they sent me a refurbished phone if not this is a very bad phone,negative

coming from the iphone with an otterbox defender i knew that i wanted the same protection around my new iphone so when i upgraded to the s i could not find the new otterbox defender anywhere came home and jumped on amazon right awaypoof there it was until i got my new otterbox i put a temp case on it incipio dual pro it was ok just not an otterbox though the defender case snaps around phone securely like the iphone case does when sliding the rubber bumper around into the grooves of the shell you will have to massage it into place there are  tiny tabs at the bottom by fingerprint opening those need to be pushed into place for a secure fit i takes some doing but nonetheless it goes together nicely and fits great i feel  better with the otterbox in place i work for a living so the last thing i am is gentle rubber that fits over the shell is nonslip and offers great grip material is not like a tpu cover great color combos here on amazon toothanks amazon for making this availableprime is the best,positive
the phone from keeran come as described but was locked he was able to take it off though if the apple id is locked u cannot register it,positive

after reading a ton of reviews for budget smart watches i settled on this brand was easy to charge programming is difficult and took a few hours and youtube videos to mastercalling texting and updates workgreat starter piecethe fit was great for my bf but he has very large wrists face is large and he has no problems using his big hands during operation,positive
great phone met my expectations and is another solid phone from blu i had the studio c hdpros very fast does not feel laggy at all small and light sometimes its a con since i do not feel it in my pocket or with me on the bed nice resolution i needed an hd display for readingseeing movies on the way and looks great nice battery time i can be sometimes with  or  days without recharging it and its still therecons no additional space i do not need that much space but i know i cannot carry my full music collection on this phone gets hot on heavy usage i do not mind too much but its noticeable when playing games that the top back gets somehow warm probably due to the small form factoroverall a pretty satisfied customer with a phone that works great for what was bought for,positive
i wanted a good cheap phone and this was just the right thing for me very simple to use for the person who does not want anything where he has to learn how to use it,positive

this is one big phone not for those with small hands it works great it works just as well as name brand android phones costing  times as much i also use it as a tablet mostly for internet or watching videos or as a music player through the aux input on the car radio i have not loaded it up with a huge number of apps so i cannot say if it would be as fast however i detect no slowing at all i am definitely recommending this brand to my family and friends,positive
came as claimed near flawless condition i could not find anything wrong with it if i tried only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum no apple logo or and writing at all but it grew on me its very sleek phone operates as expected and is lightning fast i would suggest to anyone,positive

excellent phone for the money it has  it is fast with lots of memory for all my apps and photos has not once choked on me yet and it comes almost stock android without a bunch of bloatwarethe camera takes great pics with good lighting or with the flash since it has no image stabilization action shots in low light may suffer phones with better cameras cost twice as much or more i like the fact that this phone works on almost any network which allows me to switch carriers when i want all in all this phone should more than meets my needs for a good while to come,positive

excellent fluid phone very good battery usage and works perfectly in the dominican republic,positive
a solid phone that is running the latest build of windows  mobile very well,positive
this is a great phone as mentioned by others but with major shortcoming as well i bought it for some very specific uses like the gps amoled display and hdmi output and for that it cant be beat although the phone is a little heavy it is not difficult to carry but it is noticeable because of the keyboard and metallic body there is also no more updates so what you get is what you have to do with because installing apps is difficult and microsoft makes sure all default links get broken but the system that comes with it works just like android and i like it better although both work the same way pretty much the first thing you have to do is charge it and then turn off everything pretty much because the battery only lasts for like  hours with default settings with things like g and wifi off you get like  days of use as a phone i started turning on things one at a time until i got  days of use and also the sleeping clock that is always on like an led display no lockups and such maybe because i did not try to run many apps at the same time it works exactly like android so anyone who has  who is used a tab would find it all familiar but since microsoft killed all links and support many app functions are broken new versions of whatsapp is still being done but with broken links for so many apps you cant just use anything installing apps now is a long process but it can be done overall for the price and what i want to use it for it cant be beat the gps with amoled display is great while driving during the daytime mp camera is not bad but its just for when you do not have anything else hdmi output is great for presentations and over all even with the problems i am happy the phone is heavy and the metal makes it slippery so you need a cover but it is not a burden and keep in mind the problems it does have not for gamers and such this is more like a business phone with a keyboard,positive
this is the perfect phone to send to cuba for your love ones they say its has the best reception ever highly recommend,positive
love it nice clear display makes it easier to use skype than on my samsung galaxy yim using a sim card from wwwspeakoutelevenca i do not have data with it as im only using prepaid vouchers and do not have a plan with speakout so far so good,positive
looked everywhere for this phone found it so happy love windows  easy to use works like a charm,positive
phone works great had for about  months with no problems,positive
the product page explains it i mean there has  there is really not much more to say about it although one feature i did not pay attention to the flashlight push the spacebar button for a second while unlocked or hold it down when it has  it is locked is really bright it has  it is actually the flash for the camera too,positive
pros superb quick charge superb performance for a mid range device superb multitasking with gb of ram loving the zen ui launcher came with gb of additional google drive storage yes the battery is swappable requires abit of knowledge  sim card slotscons outer casing is plastic rear camera is easily scratched but has not effect the quality of the pictures yet speakers could be louder battery could be longer maybe have an option for lights on the permanent touch buttons,positive
nice phone great interface much better the samsung would recommend if looking for a quality phone without contract great for the money,positive
i bought this phone as being unlocked it was not i called att and they registered my simms card and went to turn it on nothing why it needs a simms card with unlocked pin att did not know what i was talking about nice phone to look at so im going to try to take it to the corporate att store and then probably to apple store i will give a better review after i drive a hour to these stores check out my new review did not have to drive grreat phone clear reception and voice no problems yes i woould recommend this seller ,positive

excellent phonei live in ontario canada very hard to get an unlocked samsung gs here so i had to get this through family in the us still cheaper than a no contract unlocked one here through one of our major carriers despite the currency exchange and the shippingsamsung region locks its phones annoying had to do some research on which bands are supported on which model of the sfully functional with telus including its g lte network also tested on the bell network cannot be sure that it works on rogers but probably works,positive
absolutely worth the price minor dings around the edges but nothing to compromise the phones functionality extremely satisfied with the purchase,positive
good camera and very nice,positive
ive had this for  days now and so far its great the camera is good mp and the front camera is  mp but what makes it great is the front flashi like the size of it internal memory  gb you only get about  or  gb over all it functions as well as any s or s basic samsung functions but the price greati use mine on metropcs had to call them to let them add it to their network which is free and i do get lte speeds with it which is excellent,positive
met my expectations,positive
i am with tmobile prepaid and i do not have a data plan but i am around wifi most of the time so i bought this phone ive been using palm products for years this phone blew me away with functionality the keyboard is amazing to type on i connect with my international friends through skype on this phone for free and i get my gmail and my instant messages from various im services get yourself fring or nimbuzz and go to skype dot com to get native skype i read twitter i get to open my pdf lecture files and my college papers any time i want i can get on most any website i also love calendar and alarms on this device the screen is small compared to my large screen palm but i do not care because the device is very slim has unbelievable battery life and features full qwerty keyboard i am taking all these over the large screen i prefer this keyboard to touch input by far,positive
this phone is great for the price so far ive had it now for  days no problems ive order another one to replace my cubot p phone which started having a netflix freezing issue anyway i love that this phone is in english not like the huawei honor c android  which was in chinese also you can remove installed apps from screen but this phone does not come with all that useless garbage i love the fact that i just swapped my sim card from my old phone into the blu phone and chaged my apn setting to net which was already programmed into the phone yes there are at least  other companies preprogramed this phone plays netflix with no issues the sound of calls are very loud and clear to hear though the speaker phone unlike the cubot p the screen is very nice and responsive the phone moves quickly overall as of now this is the best cheap phone money can buy and ive bought alot of cheap phones hopefully this will be my last ill update this review if i have any problems with this phone,positive
great phone no problems with it,positive
worth the money,positive
definitely happy,positive
excellent phone it has  it is just beautiful i had a little problem with the color but the seller quickly solved it,positive

great phone kinda big but overall a great little phone ,positive
the phone is working good for most partbut camera is ok,positive
read many reviews before purchasing this phone is small but the software and features allow this phone to compete with any modern smartphone today this phone has amazing battery life and super fluid response for games web browsing and messaging only thing ive noticed is that for my personal usage i will need to buy a micro sd card to store my spotify tracks this is easily the best phone i have owned and i have used droids windows phones and iphones beforesony also has a very nice display and speakers packed into this phone one last selling point for me is that sony has packed in a magnetic charging port into the side of this phone allowing the user to do away with the bent pins of micro usb cables while it is a separate purchase to get the magnetic charging cable i went ahead and bought  of them for the home and the car wsken makes a model that supports quick charge  through magnetic charging if you are wanting that overall  when this phone breaks i will definitely be an xperia buyer from now on,positive
wellit is a very solid case and i know and feel like it could withstand a five foot drop oopsa bit pricey but would still definitely recommend,positive
i have been a huge fan of htc since i got my htc m that has lasted me well for  years now but it was time to upgrade as the battery life has become poor over the years so naturally i thought of htc again and they have not disappointed me still i love my new htc  i purchased the gold and it is gorgeous im unable to take a proper picture that would do its beauty justice so you will just have to take my word for it very sturdy feeling phone in the had and great design the phone is also super fast and charges extremely quickly so far i am extremely happy with my purchase i received the uk it seems which included earphones and the seller even included a us adapter for my charger which i really appreciated,positive
better then expected for the price battery life is very good i did not charge mine for over a week and when i did the battery was still at  i do not my day glued to the phone but i still use it about an hour or more a day camera is even good not great but good i am liking it more each day,positive

solid phone bigger than ive hoped had st moto g and was super happy with it has  it is size finger scan works beautifully and fast when i was deciding on plus vs normal moto g thought that finger scan would be nothing more than nice to have  now is proving super useful especially as our it sec policies are stringent and require min  digit pin with finger scan it is a breeze it has  it is fast and reliable camera is  mediocre have not played with settings a lot but photos somehow seem a bit out of focus even with focusing on object etc not saying that they are blurred or anything just comparing to other cameras out there photis seem to be lacking depth etc everything else really works great  phone is super fast and feels nice in the hand again if only it was a bit smaller it would again be an unbeatable combo,positive
was kinda lerious at first after ordering and noticing some more of the bad reviews but once i got it it seemed like brand new with one very very small scuff mark on the back from setting it on a table perhaps and no scratches on the screen very pleased and arrived  days early,positive
great phonefilled all my needs,positive
it has  it is super light i had a samsung s before so it was easy to get the hang of everything i easily set it up great phone it looks great as well it seems just as fast to me as the s however techs are not as good the screen actually seems more vibrant than my s video quality not as well but i already knew that and i watch videos on my laptop or tv instead anyways great phone,positive

ive used a few of blus budget phones so far this is my favorite budget phone from blu the phone looks premium and is fast blu includes a case screen protector installed usb adapter and headphones the radio and software on this version of android  works without any glitches for me tmobile however the ui may have some annoying features or lack of depending on users tastes i mostly appreciate the gb ram fingerprint scanner and good battery life i mostly dislike the nonremovable battery and the lack of widgets there is no nfc or gyroscope but i do not use those sensors i havent had volume or ringer troubles as others have mentioned however notifications lights and lighted navigation buttons would have been nice still i have no major gripes that compromise the way i use android phones and ive happily made this my main phone based on my experience with blu phones the most important measure for me is how well the phone holds up over time and if it gets any os updates from blu not likely,positive
an extraordinary experience i received exactly what i bought the rest is history,positive
i got it for my dad and he loved it,positive
yes it was a good buy,positive

great phone,positive
the  gs has slightly less resolution than the i but it is so clear i do not think you would notice the difference the only other difference between the  is that the i has  camerafront and rear for video chatting the i gs is the same as the i except siri was added if you do not need your phone to talk to you and you do not need video chatting then the gs does everything else it came with the latest upgrade of the ios operating system and the screen was scratch free while i do not understand it completely apparently there is a big difference between factory unlocked and jailbroken it is my understanding that when jailbroken any upgrade relocks the phone cannot say enough good about the seller as advertised and delivered on time at a very low price for what i got  a great value when its time to upgrade i will return here to purchase,positive

lovely little phone i got after my iphone  was stolen comes in fun colors and everything i could ask for in a phone only thing that has  that is really lacking to me is the camera especially in low light scenes not bad enough to knock off a star though besides that little kink this phone fills the need of a digital life companion and for the price paid i could not ask for anything better,positive

excellent phone i expected horrible battery life due to this phone being so thin but it has  it is actually not bad at alli use a  amp micro usb charger and it charges from  to  in about an houri know this will shorten the battery life over time but so far it works greatovernight i use a standard  amp chargerthe performance on the phone is also amazing no stuttering when moving from screen to screen and the ability to keep multiple apps open in the background works greatcannot wait for it to get android  as per blus promise this phone is going to get android  but it has  it is a matter of whenonly con i have for it is the small storage gb about  usable out of the box but i knew that when i ordered the phone so i cannot complain thus i am not taking any stars off could had used a microsd card slot but i guess since the phone is so thin then there was no room for it,positive
one of the best packaging was great  the device is idle  thanks to the seller,positive
bought these for my daughters  not too expensive but have all the features they love great buy works fine,positive
this phone is amazing it was purchased a few weeks for my mother before she went to africa sierra leone to be exact and she switched to another sim card while in africa and it worked perfectly we were able to communicate clearly just as we did when the phone was used in the us the internet is also very fast with the g network from simple mobile and i believe that has  that is mainly because it is an international phone so the range goes a whole lot farther the only problem we noticed is that the battery needs to be charged quite often when it is used to surf the web and gps is used the seller is also very reliable,positive
awesome phone,positive
this is a review for the blu studio c mini not the c hd the two devices are however very similar and everything in this review applies to the c hd except the c hd has more ram a better screen and  fullsize sim card slots however i feel a  inch screen is just a little bit too big to use with one hand so i recommend the c mini speed this phone is fast the  megs of ram prevent games such as asphalt  from running but the android ui and games like subway surfers and even slightly more intense games run very fluidly the  ghz quad core processor is no slouch either battery life the battery is good and even comparable to my lg fs  mah battery with littlemoderate use it will last a long time heavy gaming will deplete the battery in  hourswith wifi and gps on oh and did i mention the phone charges from  in  hr  minutes osui this phone is pretty much stock android kitkat  with a couple nice extra features such as scheduled power on and off a battery charge time indicator an apps to sd function disabled in stock android since  and even a built in os integrated antivirus blu has made android almost perfect only having the phone come factory rooted could make it better screen the screen is nice crisp and bright it has pretty good viewing angles may be  degrees or so it does not seem at all pixelated even with such a low ppi  or so the screen is well calibrated and very vivid call quality call quality on tmobiles network is good and the phone even supports video calls though my sim does not speaker the speaker is quite loud but sounds tinny it works well on speakerphone but wear headphones or use externalbluetooth speakers for music i tested wired external speakers and headphones and it had really good sound quality it even supports a  surround system without a receiver cameras i do not take photos with my phone but i tested the image quality out quite frankly the back camera is pretty bad for  megapixels and autofocus it can read qr codes though and that has  that is all i need it for the front camera is useable at least for skype and selfies build quality the device is built quite well and does not feel cheap with the case on i asked a friend how much he thought it cost and he guessed  wow ghspa its quite fast ive gotten up to  mbps on hspag on tmobile and  mbps on g my lg optimus f glte got  in the same location but the point is its useable it also uses less battery than lteodds and ends the gyro sensor is not calibrated so games that do not have a calibrate button like temple run you will have to play while slightly lobsided i will update this review with a fix if i can find onethe phone comes with a pair of terrible headphoneswith a mic attached a screen protector a casewhich adds that more premium feel and protects only the back and sides from scratches and a wall charger usb  cablethe phone supports otgthe phone allows you to hotspottether your phone on any carrier even if the carrier does not allow it because the hotspot app is part of android itselfthe phone does have a led notification lightand also the brightest flashflashlight ive ever seen on a phoneverdict do not hesitate to buy this phone for  unlocked you cannot go wrong unless you want the  moto e which is also fabulous i will review it soonon the main amazon page for the c mini it shows say a black and white phone and labels the color as yellow do not pay attention to the pictures the color of the actual device is what the label under in stock saysi think this has been fixed by nowif anyone has any questions at all about this device ask it in a comment to this review and i will answer also with a comment as fast as possible update i have just discovered the stock launcher keeps removing all the apps on the sd card from the home page on boot a simple fix for this is to download nova launcherthe gps albeit accurate depletes the battery in roughly an hour and a half because that has  that is the same time it takes it to charge the battery will only remain level if the phone is plugged in with gps in useit boots up in  seconds if you turn on the fast boot setting this can be found under settingsaccessibilityfastbootupdate the phone still runs strong though i have needed to purchase a new screen protector the youtube app from google sticks sometimes due to lack of support but there are other youtube apps out there so no biggie battery life is still good the capacitive buttons seem to lag a second or so can be fixed through onscreen buttons on play store the led on the back doubles as the brightest phone flashlight i have ever seen though it does get hot after long periods of use after i put in my new sim card sms messages would not work a simple solution is to go under settingsmorewireless  networksmobile networksnetwork operators tap select manually ok then tmobile g g hspa is technically a version of g you may have to wait a minute while it searches for available networks then restart the phone hold power button then rebootok this will likely also work for other cards as well i also realized the sim  slot is the hspa slot and the other is normal gsmupdate  my phones back camera now has a small hairline crack this is likely because the camera actually sticks out past the included case so it is the first point of impact on a fall to the back the camera still functions and the crack is virtually invisible both to me and the phones camera it does not appear in photos also now that android l lollipop has come out i can speculate that i will never get an os update i have not gotten one in three months lets hope they send out the update eventually meanwhile my nexus  is well android has never been betteralso sometimes i boot up my phone and it unlocks itself other times it sets avast off thinking i have removed the sim card because the second card is not present the upside to this is that avast locks my phone on boot p the downside is the alarm noise which i have overwritten with a recording of absolute silence so it sorted itself outfinal update rip blu studio c minii have managed to kill my phone through rooting if anyone wants to play with root beware the phone can be rooted through the free kingroot app it has  it is in chinese but it is quite straightforward nonetheless root at your own risk rooting caused system crashes and randomly occurring reboots there are no custom roms or forums for this phone there is no stock rom image available to download online also updates become locked after rooting even if the phone is unrootedin short do not root itupdate  i managed to save my phone by flashing a micromax android l rom onto it i commented on the website that it worked and they actually created a webpage about it months ago which is pretty amazing ive never ported a rom before anyway now there is a rom to use if you have rooted your phone and want to upgrade to cyanogenmod android l it has some bugs and i cannot code well enough to fix them the biggest issue is that it no longer accepts sim cards and ive been unable to fix that thus far although i promise i will work on it heres a link with that said in  this phone is absolutely no longer worth iti said i would post again when i figured out how to recalibrate the gyroscope well i figured it out if you boot the phone into factory mode hold down power and volume down on boot until a menu appears and use the volume down key to highlight item test then press menu the soft button on the bottom left of the screen use the volume down button to highlight gsensor calibration  press the menu button to select it then press the menu button again to calibrate the sensor make sure the phone is on a flat surface during calibrationto reboot the phone into normal android press the back button repeatedly until you are back to the main factory mode menu use the volume down button to highlight reboot  press the menu button to select it the phone will then boot up normally do not worry if it takes a little longer than usual this time or tells you that android is upgradingupdate   i was curious to see what had happened with the studio and i was surprised by how popular it is for a generic brand phone i just wanted to throw a couple new thoughts out there  the phone no longer holds a full charge and replacement batteries are impossible to find  the phone msrps for  not   if you can spend  on a phone go buy the  moto e it is so much better than the studio c mini at a very similar pricei will not update this review again it has  it is really long but i am always open to answer any questions you may have,positive
this was my second phone from this seller both exactly as described fast shipping great,positive

i received this phone yesterday even though it says it is used it came in original packaging and the stickers were still on the back of the phone the battery was fully charged when it arrived inside the package was a note from the seller asking me to contact them if i had any problems and they would be happy to make it right ive bought a lot of stuff from amazon and that was the first personal note from a seller it was impressive the phone is in excellent condition it looks brand new i do not use the internet on my phone so i cannot speak to that i already had att as my carrier so i have no idea about the locked or unlocked state of the phone i transferred my sim card and turned it on good to go what i can say is that the phone i replaced was an original rugby that i have used for over five years i never had any trouble with it until recently the camera and the speaker were going bad i checked att for a replacement phone this phone was cheaper by far plus i did not have to renew my contract or pay a  fee to upgrade it this phone has all the same features of the original probably more i just have not really looked so it has  it is easy for me to use and the speaker is fantastic it rings loud enough on the highest setting that even i with my not so perfect hearing can hear it from across the house i can hear calls perfectly without having to put them on speaker phone it is a rugby so i know that it can take a licking and keep on going if you want a phone for talk and text that will last through the oopses of life this is the best one on the market i look forward to many years of service from my new phone i will also recommend the seller to my friends,positive

ive been extremely happy with this phone ive been using it for about  months now and have never had any issues it works just as well if not better than my old sony xperia t that cost  times more i love the larger screen size as well since i have large hands and find smaller phones too cramped it also makes reading articles or books very easy on this device ive used a lot of phones over the years and have to say that this is by far my favorite to date you cannot beat the price either as blu phones are only a fraction of the cost of other phones that are really no better in quality from my experience blu is also an american company based out of miami im always happy to support american businesses i will definitely buy blu phones from here on out,positive
great phone got it the next day,positive

finally i received my blu life  and i am very happy with it,positive
everything works great the battery lasts all day with regular use the screen is not lacking although rough on contrast and it can hold plenty of apps the camera is interpolated from mp up to  and does not focus which is expected for the price point it still works well with detachable macro  wide angle lenses g networking actually works on subatt gsm networks like consumer cellular overall it is awesome considering the current price the phone does not get hot from charging or use and yet it is not slow compared to other similar phones with the same ghz chipset the one and only thing that is lacking is the flashlight it is the most dim flashlight ive ever seen on any phone but it has  it is still helpful in pure darkness and with videoside note one out of  ordered came with a small black halfcircle on the right side of the screen and when it was pressed just to put the phone in its case the screen cracked from the inside the other phone is flawless,positive
i just begun to use all this phone can doi can see why people can get hooked on a smart phone and this phone is so well builtso far i have internet music files email appointment scheduler good quality call tone with tmobil no contract  a month thats  minutes and unlimited data gps maps video games wifi and morei was able to sync my albums with windows media player installing them into my music files now i have the grateful dead playing lost sailor for my ring tonetotally satisfied here,positive

i have been using the posh micro x s for a week or so and it is positively liberating it is small but does messaging email and web access as you need it its not for gamers but people who just need connectivity all the time it weighs almost nothing fits in a shirt pocket and really works wellit is as small as two packages of matches but the screen in legible and once it is configured very useful we all have a phablet or a pc somewhere to do serious work after allbut for on the road and weekends this thing is a charm good and long active and inactive battery life and so light it is easy to forget it is with you i love the thing it does essentials and is not like lugging a  automatic around all day long it is unlocked so do what you will do not fall for the apple samsung etc rhetoric for  dollars this thing does all you want its even cheaper on amazon,positive
great little phonecamera  gave as gift,positive

iphone c is basically an iphone  with a colorful plastic case which makes it about a  cheaper regular iphone  and s is metal and plastic outside of the colorful plastic you really will not notice the difference between this the iphone  and the iphone s unless you are really knit picky im a samsung guy who stayed away from the iphone for years due to the small size of the phones i decided to try this one out because of the price and that it is relatively similar in size to a smaller samsung phone like the galaxy victory i had before and it has not been that big a deal to switch over so fari wanted to take the time to address some of the negative reviews regarding purchasing these phones as many come from user error if you are going to buy a used phone from a rd party vendor be sure to read the description of the phone on that specific venders profile and not the amazon listed one which is for a new phone the one i bought was refurbished but the vender mybullfrog listed specifically what it came with charger and cable the condition of the phone near great condition with perfect screen and what it did not come with a sim card putting that together basically this phone was a warranty exchange because the previous owner dropped it and cracked the screen and they just replaced it for them with a new phone fixed the screen on the other phone and is reselling it i got it exactly  days from when it was shipped and it was exactly as described picture includedwhen you buy a used phone with a sim card already in you run the risk of getting a phone that will not be able to be activated as that phone could possibly still be active on someone elses account a regular complaint on low scored reviewswhen you buy a phone without the sim you have to get the sim from the network provider of the phone in this case sprint if you do not know this information it can be a hassle which accounts for most of the complaints if you go to a corporate sprint store ie a store that does in store phone repairs they do carry sim cards there and should not charge you for them if you are activating the phone at their store though they are less than  if they do if you just go to a regular sprint store generally they will not have spare sim cards and will look at you funnyanyway so far so good i checked everything out got phone calls sent and received texts watched tv on aps used the headphone jack and it all worked perfectly so far no complaints from me,positive
really cannot beat this phone at this price point if you are sensible and do not care about brand names i recommend it the only thing this phone falls shot on compared to the higher end phones is screen brightness while you are in direct sunlight,positive
its fast adn small ir good creen bit the camera is not todo good i recomend theproduct ir you don y want to take qualitty pics,positive
great phone it is exactly as it has been describedeasy to use and affordable i am really happy with it,positive
i am very satisfied with this phone it was a good price and saved me from having to renew a contract with my provider for a year just to replace my old worn out phone all i had to do was take the sim card out of the old phone and put into the new phone and charge the battery and i was good to go i do not need all the features on the new phone but for the price i could not go wrong,positive
works great no problems at all,positive
the galaxy s is a great phone and a great way to save a bundle if you do not need to have the latest model this model was released in ,positive
i love it great phone for the price,positive
looking for a flagship with excellent camara in a compact form factor this is the equipment you are looking forthe interfase is very polishedi really really love the unlock boton in the right side with fingerprint it unlocks the phone supper fastit is true that sometimes it get hot but so far it is tolerable it took me a long time to decide for this model because i read reviews regarding the overheating issue in my case it is not a problemupdate since android  update i did not notice the hot issue anymore the interfase is more fluid the battery duration was improved be carefull with old reviews,positive
works in west africa,positive
very nice  screen unlocked gsm android phone i bought this for a trip overseas where i will buy a local sim card ive added lots of apps and a gb memory card im used to an lg phone with differently placed controls but all is well,positive
excelent really fast delivery,positive
so i have used this phone for two months i think two months is enough time to be able to give an objective review this is by far the best phone i have ever had my last  phones were sony xperia z sony xperia z lg optimus g htc one s iphone designi love the way this phone was built it has  it is light and it looks great it has  it is plastic but it feels like metal the buttons on the back are easily reachable altough i rarely use them i do not like the  mm jack at the bottom of the phonescreenthe screen is superb qhd is the best you can get today it has  it is super responsive and it looks amazing indoors outdoors is another story you have to put the brightness control at  to be able to see under direct sun light all in all this screen will wow everybodycameraexcellent camera the results are amazing you can shoot  pictures at  mpx and  mpx pictures  the dual tone flash really helps when it has  it is dark images are crisp and clear you can also record k full hd hd and  fps videos at p videos are also great the front facing camera is ok nothing too spectacular but is not bad either i just wish lg would have given the user some more options and manual controlsbatterybattery life is good i can use my phone for  hours in a normal day if your screen is on for too long the battery will suffer a drastic drop in general it is good not great but goodperformancegreat performance you can run any game or app smoothly you get  in antutu with lollipopsoftwarethis is not going to be a popular opinion but i really like what lg did with android here i feel android vanilla is very limited i really do not enjoy the vanilla android experience the interface is pretty the icons are nice the transitions are awesome you have a lot to choose from but that has  that is what android is about choicessignal and callsphone calls sound great signal is always good i have one big problem and it is the fact that i cannot get g lte from the phone without getting into the lg hidden menu  the option is simply not there if i get into the hidden menu go to lte only and select the band manually i get g but if i reboot the phone i have to do it all over againall in all this phone is amazing just buy it at this price you cannot go wrong oh something else the battery is removable and it takes micro sd cards up to  gb,positive
received  phones both were like brand new not a scratch they work great thanks better than expected,positive
ive owned iphones and android galaxy phones in the past and i bought the lumia  wp phone largely out of curiosity the hardware is excellent and the os is surprisingly good all the standard functions work very well the ui is pleasant the builtin applications are smooth fast intuitive and integrated i like the os better than android and i like the hardware better than iphone only weak link is the app store  most apps i needwantuse are available but there are fewer free namebrand apps for now,positive
ok so most of the reviews out there say this is not as good as the z premium that is a blatant lie compared to the zp the xp has a brighter screen smaller form factor and the snapdragon  is a tangible upgrade over the zps  processor there are also no heat issues whatsoeverit is however a very slippery phone,positive

as a person that recently got into the world of smart watches i had to learn a lot in a short timeim writing this review while holding an iphone because i have not seen anyone do it it does everything as described on the description you can control your music it basically works as a bluetooth speaker answer phone calls set an alarm track your steps and make calls the only things that you cannot do on an iphone is get text mail and social media notifications but if you have an android you should be fine overall the smart watch did perform to what i had expected which was good in my book,positive
very good phone works great and easy handling really like this phoneis not complicated and your system is doing very well,positive
i received the phone and it works just fine very quick shipping yes its not ur usual regular android you would buy at att or tmobile because the settings are completely different i connected mine to metro pcs and added a new vpn so it picks up g very well no it did not come g lte and it do not run fast as i want it to im a technology nerd and have used so many different phones and systems this blu energy x plus is well worth every penny i beg you please use common sense with the phone and you will figure it out comes with front camera flash and takes pretty good photos the phone is huge really a  hd screen bigger than the iphone plusoh yeah im doing my review with the blu energy x plus,positive
a good buy for the price i recommended it to my son to upgrade his rather ancient phone he is very pleased with the reception and all quality,positive
had this phone for two years love it many drops and  issues or scuffs long lasting battery hands down one of the best budget phones at the time i bought itpossible issuesthe camera can be annoying if you care to take good pictures or pictures of things with fine writing the camera is not that good no flash and no focus but i was not really bothered as i am not a camera person also no front camera sad but i managethe infamous power button issue after a year and so of using this started affecting me sometimes when you press the power button it will restart the phone instead of just waking the phone up recently after googling there are various alternatives to using the power button i have been using an app and it has  it is been good i have not noticed much battery drain so i am pretty much back at being happy with this phone,positive
received it quickly works as well as the phone it replaced,positive
arrived in perfect condition and was reset to factory in great shape and works as described,positive

i buy a new phone monthly or at least i have for the past  or so months after going through and xperia z compact an iphone c a blu life pure mini and another one m i can say without a doubt the m is the best phone i have ever used i sold my first one thinking the sd  was dated and having an  would make a difference it did nothtc put this phone together so well it still amazes me every aspect of it is perfect keep in mind tho the colored aluminum is prone to scratches so get a case i recommend uag best case for this phone by far it came in great packaging with a wall charger usb cable and headphones also came with an oem htc micro sim opener very cool and a screen protectorthe phone itself is in good shape minus some slight scratching around the front edges but after putting the phone in it has  it is brand new uag case you cannot see them at all the first m i purchased had the infamous puple camera this one does not thankfully my only gripe is i use a net simcard so i cannot receive updates since this is an unlocked att phone so i am stuck on android next weekend im going into att and if i can activate it on their service with a garuntee that i will receive the update to lollipop or atleast kitkat ill gladly pay the extra  a monthif you are like me and are buying an unlocked phone and you want the full package without spending  dollars the m is for you its snapdragon  with adreno  will handle anything you can toss it has  it is way with ease the camera reminds me of my iphone which is very rare for android phones most of the cameras out there are terrible the all aluminum body is stellar and the screen pops like no other phone ive used so sharp and bright be sure to get a screen protector preferably tempered glass   mm keep in mind that the battery is not the largest by any means and this is an att phone so unless you use their service or root your phone with a custom rom you will be stuck with jellybeani bought from breed so i cannot speak for any of the other sellers they sent out a great unit for the money that included all accessories the last m i bought off amazon came in a week with just the phone and a broken otterbox and cost  more but it had  it would had been updated to this will be my last phone purchase for a year or more buy one now while you can htc is a great company that will support it has  it is flagships to the grave it has  it is big brother the m could never quite recrate the rugged industrial look that i love about the m but it has  it is snapdragon  is impressive i will probably buy the m next but lets see what it has in store first i know this phone inside and out so feel free to ask me any questions,positive

i purchased this after reading great reviews and i could not be more satisfied for the price this phones sound is unbelievable and the screen is every bit as good as my galaxy s very lightweight for the large size love that i can addchange memory card via a popout tray on the side one potential drawback for heavy phone users is nonremovable batter but great for average phone use music podcasts and video good camera with plenty of options too unlike some lowerpriced phones has latest version of lollipop,positive
holy moly  i finally found the right phone this thing is amazing camera is amazing speed is amazing looks amazing i love it,positive
am very well satisfied,positive
phone came in the original att box and in great condition as stated it says it is unlocked but does not work for sprint it works perfectly for tmobile though before this phone i used a tmobile samsung galaxy exhibit g a first generation android that was small  or so and very light i was not looking for the latest smartphone iphone but something affordable and efficient for basic functions this phone is it it has  it is  and heavier but it fits well since i easily drop my phone it operates on windows  and contains features and apps that are easily accessible and easy to use such as facebook twitter nokia maps etc it has an megapixel rear camera but a very bad front camera  megapixel hence it has  it is decent camera quality i am a tad sad that i cannot take good selfies since i use my phone moderately and its functions its battery life lasts long though ive only had it for about  weeks good performance overall and fast connection internet with g,positive

ive been very impressed with this phone it was unlocked and easily setup to run on a my carrier tmobile aside from just being good looking and very quick to change between apps and programs it had pretty decent volume for a phone certain greater than previous generation lg phones but what really makes it stand out is its camera i do photography as a hobby and have certainly geeked out at the extreme depth of field shots you can when shooting up close the focus is sharp and quick and i find my shots turning out much better than my girlfriends an iphone i highly recommend it for anybody who puts their camera first when making their phone purchases,positive
this is the best budget phone you can get in my honest opinion it has it all a quadcore processor gb ram gb rom good looking it feels good in your handthe camera is not the greatest but is pretty good for this pricethe software run pretty smoothly and fast ive installed a lot of apps with no problems at allthe only downside is the battery life but it has  it is not a big deal,positive

i have been extremely delighed with my blackberry curve  i recieved it as promised on time and have been learning all the functions etc had only a slight problem with getting my service provider to get it provisioned but that has  that is in the past,positive
the best phone ive ever owned fast crystal clear display easy to use interface i came from an iphone s a few years ago and moved to the htc one which i liked at first but slowly realized how many problems i had with it it was a great phone but it was fairly slow the camera sucked and the interface was pretty terrible i had a hard time learning it as a former iphone user i almost switched back to iphone but then i considered this galaxy s edge plus i pulled the trigger and bought it on amazon needed this version so i could use it on cricket this phone has not stopped amazing me since i got it the display is big and sharp and crystal clear the photos are in stunning detail and come out beautiful every time the phone is incredibly fast and the interface is really easy to use which could have more to do with android updates than htc vs samsung but idk the edges are not very useful i like being able to read the clock on it at night instead of having to pick up the phone to view the time but other than that they are more of a gimmick but they do look cool so i still count them as a plus the fit and finish of the phone is excellent,positive

very nice color and soft crystal clears screen very hand held,positive
perfect for my wife,positive

ok i love this phone i recently destroyed my samsung galaxy s and needed a replacement i did not like the s and did not want to commit to another  year contract for the s then i found this little guy oh man ive had it for about a week now and i still love it battery life is great and recharges quickly when depleted i love the camera the slow motion video the expert camera mode you know what else i love i love that the fm radio receiver which all smart phones have is not disabled i can listen to fm radio without using an app that uses data like iheartradio or something would use true it has  it is only local stations but that has  that is not the point the point is that the manufacturers include a radio in your phone that your carrier decides to disable to protect their monopoly on your data heres another good thing about this phone it has  it is unlocked so you can use it on whatever carrier you want take it abroad use it in a different country just by switching sim cards how can you not get behind thatmy wife uses a samsung galaxy note and she loves it but when it gets time to replace it she has  she is going with one of these babies because she sees how much i enjoy it she may not appreciate all the technical advantages this phone has over others but she does like the looks form factor and interface in short it has  it is a joy to use,positive
product was delivered on time in great condition was for overseas markets with a  volt recharger but configured for usb recharging also so no problem worked as advertised unlocked and i installed an international sim card that is compatible with us carriers no problems or issues to date,positive
it worked great but it did not meet the international requirements for china no chinese language available for this phone,positive
i love my phone it has  it is a really bright pink but i love it,positive
i love my new phone i was hesitant about rolling my accts over because i thought it would be tedious it was not,positive
happy excelent,positive
the lg arrived very fast it was sealedi am new to android but can defiantly say it is a good productthe camera is very impressive especially the videoi had iphone before the iphone fluent user interface is very addictive however there is no real comparison between the two products the lg is like a ballistic missal and has the capabilities to do much more than the iphonei love the lg swift keyboard it is amazingbattery life on the lg is a bit disappointing but i heard that after longer use it is getting better,positive
excellent for the price using it with tmobile pay as you goi love the bigger screenit did come with some att pre installed bloatware that i assume i dont know for sure cannot be removedcpu speed feels same or faster than iphonenice to comfortably browse internet with mobile chrome on the goi think by todays standard this is considered entry level compared to other modelshowever for my use it exceeded expectationsgenerally speaking people should take a lot of time todo their homework and carefully compare the million features all phones have vs price pointfor the phones available on the market and then purchase according to their individual needs,positive
both my parents enjoy using this phone immensely also one of the main reasons i bought it was because of the multiple languages that you can switch to for my parents specifically chinese simplified for my mum traditional for my dad easy to use interface and navigation even for techchallenged older people i think,positive
great phone love it hopefully they will make one of these for version,positive
love this phone i do not like touch screen at all so my husband bought me a used blackberry works great,positive

okay i have to say that i love this phone it has  it is just the cats meow nice big screen lots of great features inmates calls with no problem there has  there is a lot of reviews that are pre software update about lte problems which have been addressed they have upgraded the software so the battery last longer i do not get me wrong it has  it is still not the longest lasting battery but you get about what you get with your other phones like the samsung galaxy and many of the other phones huawei has this hands down as does apple from what i understand not much i can say bad about this phone few times the speaker has locked up on me and is not heard me when i was answering calls for asking google a question i rebooted a couple times and it has  it is fine it may turn out to be a problem although after the reboot it has  it is been fine as i said for the price i do not know that you can do much better it has  it is a really good phone,positive

after a long wait the iphone  is now here thanks samsung for messing up the note  launch i would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device over  million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on samsungs part has been filed for damages so it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the s failed to captivate the market place the iphone  is a stunning phone visually i picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed i do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time but still this integration is not perfect i spent over  dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which i refuse to do also i do fear i may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like i have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out you definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to all your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot the touch id and home button are on the front at the bottom both of your volume and power buttons are on the side the back is a little different now boasting a mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s and edgehere are some more details on the specslte bands                   non expandable storage gb gb gb retina hd x displaya processor ip wide angle and telephoto apertureif you are wondering about ios  well it comes stock with the iphone  and with good reason they made a lot of incremental changes that adds up emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but its great to see apple join the bandwagon siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp sony lyrics were added to apple musicitunes even voice mail transcription is available like usual gaming performance on ios  is great games from asphalt  to modern combat  plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nougets vulkan api they still dont look as good as they do here overall i think i said a line that describes this phone perfectly they made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season thanks very much for reading this review,positive

it worked  old but useful,positive

this is my th budget moto smartphone ive owned and used the moto g as well as the st and nd gen moto e the moto g is far superior to all of those but it does not have the same magic that the original moto g hadi really think that google took over motorola and made the moto g with the main intention of making the company more appealing to sell google sold motorola for a very good profit to lenovo shortly after the great success of the moto g i still have my moto g and very much cherish that phone for it has  it is great features and excellent build qualityi purchased the moto g with gig hd and  gig of ram so that i would not need to worry about space for my apps converting micro sd cards as internal storage in marshmellow does not work as well as it should apps need to be supported for this feature and only a handful in the app store seem to be plus only very high speed memory cards will work properly all three of my class  cards by pny sandisk and lexar get a warning stating that they are too slow when i try to make them part of the internal storage the screen is sharp although i prefer the look of the  inch p ips screen on the iphone plus i do not know what it is but the screen on the moto g just does not have the same vibrancy or quality still the motor g screen is plenty bright and nice to look atthe front facing speaker sounds great and buttons feel mostly responsive when pressed the fingerprint scanner works better than any other phone ive triedturbo charging is also a great feature that i could not live without especially since i usually have to charge the moto g in the afternoon to comfortably get through the evening ive been getting about  hours of screen on time between charges the camera takes decent pictures and focuses quickly most everything on this phone is really nice and snappy nfc might be a feature some will miss not me thougheven though to me the moto g does not make me giddy like the orifinal moto g my opninion is that you cannot go wrong with this purchase the moto g really is a good phone for someone who needs a device that works well has the important premium features and does not break the bank,positive
this phone was purchased as a gift we had to go to verizon for a sim card but the phone works great,positive

excellent product apple iphone  gb white  att just buy it releases it to another operator and the phone is excellent im coming for  years of use and has never given me any problems and is still updating to ios  and going completely fluidthis was an opinion based product in a neutral position and also purchased from my pocket,positive
i am a maintenance technician that implies that i am working in very dusty and wet environment the phone meant to be used mostly at work so that this was the best i could find in the case given and the price was so sweet just  bucks almost like finding it on a street that has  that is all there is to it,positive

this was a replacement case for my old ob case fits the phone great protects it as well the belt clip is a waste it makes an already bulky item more bulkycounting the one from my wife and sons phone there are  of them sitting around the house taking up space as far as protection as long as water is not a major concern this is a great case it is not waterproof in any way,positive
this was a replacement for the exact phone i had i am not going to say why the other one quit suffice it to say do not be too zealous in trying to get fingerprints and other grime off of it  ,positive

i love the phone but unfortunate for me mine is on a att tower an i do not get good service where i am but the phone itself is great an would recommend,positive
i have had my phone for about two weeks now and i am loving it because it is my first smartphone i had to get a new sim card from att but as an out of contract customer this was provided at no cost to me i am still trying to learn all of the bells and whistles and as it has been on the market for several years im sure there are other phones out there that have a lot more bling but this one is good for me the only real con i have found is because it is an older model phone i cannot find the type case and screen protector i want for the phone but i have a cute case on it not so great for protection  and hopefully since i have a quite lifestyle the screen will not need a protector i tried the film kind and they did not work very well for someone like me who just wants a good basic smart phone that has good internet features for accessing things like facebook and email weather maps etc it is a very good phone for the money looks great as well i love the white colorespecailly with my pink case,positive
more than what i expected great phone and everything else i would buy it again in a heartbeat,positive
worked great  was easy to get on a prepaid card and switched carriers with no fuss cool watch ,positive

bought this lg g d phone from breed via amazon initially i did not like it because it had terrible battery life along with a few other problems the new android  software was recently released and installed by t mobile the new version of software significantly improved the battery life and the performance of the phone i strongly recommend this phone as a cost effective high performance phonemy family now prefers the new models of lg phones over the galaxy phones,positive
battery issues says  charged way too soon unplug it and it shows not fully charged and it goes from  to  charge left to dead and shuts down not happy need to contact seller regarding replacement battery phone itself is good will update review if satisfaction is met laterreceived st contact from seller will update if they follow through update received resolution for battery issue i appreciate that and now that my only issue is no more i can honestly say they care so know that you can order from them without any misgivings i will be ordering another cell for my son soon and will go through them again,positive

i love this phone it has all that i am interested in having on a cel phone pictures are great even selfies it does have a flash on the front that works less as a flash and more as a flashlight but does the trick anyway it also has a decent amount of memory so that i can load it up with the most common apps the screen is large and the colour is different and very prettyup to now it has worked for me very well,positive
arrived in perfect new condition and is working well,positive
purchased this phone for my husband who wanted something small lightweight with all the features of a larger touch screen this little phone is super cool and easy to use the phone is so light and small you may forget you actually have it in your pocket everything about this phone is small the text and apps are micro so reading glasses are a must if your sight challenged the keypad display is incredibly small so purchasing a micro stylus is helpful unless you have small little fingertips the phone is supercool all the service attendants at att gathered around us examining it like it was a small foreign object from outer space i must give a shout out to mike at posh for his tech support mike thanks for helping me,positive
love the phone no issue at all,positive

love this phone graduated from the moto g and preciously and iphone  and previously iphone  and g best phone ive used out of those not the highest end specs but phone has a ton of nice but nonoverwhelming features only minor complant is the moto voice does not always pick up my voice but at the bar last night kept cutting on when i never said anything close to my keywords ive turned that off and went with standard google now ok google  recommend,positive
writing this review after using this device for  month this is going to be a straight forward review without going too much into the specshaving used this device i can safely say that this is the best and beast of a phone performance is just top notch i have installed like  games already including dytona racing asphalt  etc they run so smoothlyscreen  gorgeous screen i have used till date text is very sharp on screen the only problem i faced is using this device in direct sunlight i have to up the brightness to  to use in suncamera  i can safely say this is the among the best camera in mobile devices of course lg g is out and it is no comparison to this phone however more manual controls are welcomegaming performance  mind blowing installed  games asphalt  dytona racing subway surfers etc handles them without any lagbattery  medium usage will last you more than  day medium to high usage will last about a day and high users will have to charge device twiceaudio  nice output from the read speaker and music processing in headphones is good tooui  beautiful ui knock on and knock code features are my favorite lg ui offers lot of options and customizationto sum up for about  you cannot go wrong with choosing lg g bang for your buck,positive

it is a great cell phone amazing graphics and operativity i used iphone but totally i prefer the htc one mini and the android system,positive
nexus phones never let me down direct support to google faster os and overall smooth interface this phone only gets better with time,positive
so i purchased this phone as i wanted a phone that was unlocked and was quad band it was also really important for the phone to have wifi and bluetooth i have never used an s based phone i have to say im pleasently suprised the phone was designed very smartly the shortcuts make sense and you can modify them the side buttons as mentioned by other posters are really hard to use but they rarely arethe os allows for great customization and the use of any software you want a little know how is nice to have but not really necessaryskype works through fring with a native skype client in the works the browser has been thoroughly though of and works very well the email client works greatthe pictures do not do this phone justice the phone really does look great very thin and very professional feel to iti would highly suggest this phone to anyone that wants a phone just as capable as the iphone without all the hype,positive

i cant remember if i rated my blackberry since ive been a blackberry advocate since  i decided to write a reviewi bought the phone the day after it was released on amazon for  bucks although its a hefty bill and alot different then my  i love it ive had my share of issues with the phone but all of them get fixed by a restart of the phone or checking for updates and usually the update will fix the previous bugs such as wont charge when powered off group text not working  and  more battery life with the new update i hear a lot of complaints with the phone with applications im here to tell you blackberry isnt made for web browsing and using it as a computer but it can hold up to your expectations blackberry is able to run an application call mobile market mobile is an app that allows you to download any apk which is androi apps and run them efficiently instagram  pandora iheartradiopic stitch any application you desire amazonmobile and blackberry world should have the application you desire although snapchat doesnt work right on the phone  if you google it there is a technical way to do so but i dont care about that application i have modified the phone to my desire and disabled some things to get elite performance out of the phone like turn off applications in the background and such other things another complaint no more green light i am the biggest fan of the so bebuzzed fixed that for me with indicator light and various other lights for the girlfriend and other contacts truly in love with this phone although its a bit big i recommend buying the phone and the hard case because i had to buff out a knick in the aluminum already be aware when buying screen protectors that some companies dont have the measurements right  aside of that goodluck  enjoy your blackberry as i do blackberry i cant wait to develop the next model always wanted and updated  and the classic is the best i will see excellent job but lower the price for me next time and i will continue supporting not only quality but what i feel to be the most durable phone on the market can drop this baby anyway and not crack a screen yet thank you for listening and having excellent customer support along with amazon excellent support,positive

i bought it for my daughter she loves the clear display and the os she wishes that it supported additional sd memory card that was her only complaint the size is good not too big not too small she loves the bamboo feels samsung and apple get most of the media attention when it comes to smartphones but if you are looking for decent functionality and great value check out motorola phones if someone from motorola sees this i should get some compensation maybe another free phone for a positive review call me ,positive

one of the easiest and fastest smart phones i have used holds a signal longer than other phones texts are sent easily as are photos controls work easily jump on the internet easily download any browser you like and you are offnotifications can be turned on or off all the controls that you want are here without all the annoying things you do not want great work phone for traveling get a rubberized case for it so it can take a few knocks after a couple of years had scratched the glass but that was my fault do not drop flat on its face as the screen will crack had dropped it several hundred times prior without a problemdown side is it is the international version so the warranty is only good in the uk not in the us batteries only available from amazon or online sources and not from your local dealer if the charging port is damaged it may be difficult to repair treat that is the most fragile part of the phone do not upgrade the os if you like the installed one as it is more stable than the upgraded os and i like the clock in the older version betterliked the first one so much i bought a second one as back up put in your sim and go use android beam ntf to transfer your photos and contacts,positive
blackberry  unlocked phone with  mp camera bluetooth wifiinternational version with no warranty black is a premium product worth beyond their price  therefore it is highly recommended for their utility,positive

awesome phone at a great price have had a couple of blu phones in the past and have never been disappointing top quality device at at fraction of a big brand device lots of goodies like a case bluetooth selfie stick and screen protector basicplain android software makes device run smoothly without having all that bunch of stuff get in the way as the android versions of big brand devices cool glam flash on front camera gives you the right amount of light when need to get a selfie but not as powerful as the illumination you would get from the back camera flash but still a feature few phones have fast and responsive processing power amazing brightness details and colors delivered by its super hd amoled screen,positive

the rating goes to the phone just  stars to the seller wireless placeregarding the selleri would have qualified this sellers as  stars if the cellphone wouldve been the right model and in very good conditions as in used but no cracks blemishes etc see pictures i live outside us and urgently needed this phone so returning it was not an option for me not sellers fault and this is why im qualified them as  stars the back didnt close properly and there was a crack near the earplug the battery seal was red  wet and the worse part of all is the model offered was d the box it came in said d the sticker on the cellphone says d and the software identifies it as d what a mess  as an informative note to everyone the d versions are chinese and google dropped support for the chinese market therefore no google services could be installed so i managed to follow this crazy semiworking tutorial from xda forum on how to transform it into a dhk version with google support and now have a working smartphone again another version different from the box version the sticker on the back and the software versionregarding the phonesolid rock very fast no hangs no slow transitions clear screen high res good battery life excellent in overallpics added,positive

i bought this used htc droid incredible  as a replacement for an htc droid incredible i figured for the price i could not go wrong and i did not the item came as described and has worked properly it looks brand new the only comment i have is that usps is called snail mail for a reason i received the item on the afternoon of the last day within the delivery time frame my orders by other delivery services are usually delivered within  business daysthe only negative is not the fault of the seller as they shipped same day so i cannot dock them certainly recommend,positive
more than pleased the cellphone is unlocked and have no problem to works here in venezuela digitel the only issue is that doesnt have spanish on the configuration mode so if you dont understand english that would be a problem,positive

i have been holding off writing the review for this fantastic phone until i tested the phone properly i had bought this phone exactly a week ago when i first held it in my hands it felt perfect although i have read a few bad reviews about this phone i had complete faith in nokia therefore i went ahead and purchased this nokia phone mainly for their great build i have to admit i have been using nokia for the past  years except for years when i had to switch to samsung i hated it some of my friends suggested to me not to buy symbian based phones anymore but i think they are wrong it is still very good and as far as i am concerned this is one of the best phones available in the marketdevice set upthe initial set up for the phone was easy even i was able to transfer all the contacts texts and calendar from my other nokia phone to this phone through bluetoothdesign the design of this entire phone is excellent it fits perfectly in the palm one can operate the phone with one hand with ease there are three home screens and one can easily customise it to your requirement this you will not achieve in android or iphonekeyboard  this is perhaps the finest qwerty keyboards i have ever seen so far the keys look elegant and evenly spaced including the touchscreen qwerty keyboardscreen this phone has  amoled screen with excellent displays the touch sensitivity on this screen is brilliant which is mainly a feather touch i played a couple of p hd videos from you tube and the quality was impeccablespeaker this phone is equipped with dolby digital surround system which is equivalent to home theatres due to this you would not miss a beat the important part of the phone is the call quality which i found to be excellent in this phone i have not had any problems in call quality since i bought it a week agosoftware although many people think symbian is dead i certainly think otherwise especially after i purchased this phone the software is a huge upgrade if you are a symbian fan once my phone updated to symbian anna it works very well it did work very well even before the update the software in this phone runs as smooth as one would find it in android or iphone still there are rooms for improvementmap the ovi map is by far the best i have used in the past  months including my old nokia  xpressmusic i also own garmin  and had used google maps but they failed to beat ovi maps the best part of ovi maps is the turntoturn direction guidance furthermore ovi maps have maps for more than  countries and can be used offline moreover you can use your own voice for directionsapps there are hundreds of apps available for nokia but i do not use that many apps whatever i use works very well in e anyway who wants s of apps on their phonegames there are as many games available for nokia e as in android or iphone i have played a couple of games in nokia just to test it and it works brilliantly in ecamera the camera in e is not good unless there is enough light i have my own dslr camera which nothing can beat therefore i am not worried about the camera in the phoneupdate an update on camera this camera is certainly way better than the camera in iphone or android phones it takes very good pictures if there is enough light i did shoot a few hd  p videos a few days ago which looked excellent even my friends who own iphone and android were amazed at the quality of this videoofficeadobe nokia e comes with preinstalled office word excel and powerpoint and adobe pdf for free any iphoneandroid user has to pay some money to get officeadobe on their phone this is a huge advantage for any person who writesedits notes or spreadsheets oftenbattery this is probably a major drawback in this phone i do not understand why e comes with a short battery time when it has so many features i fully charged the battery in the morning and used a lot features more than usual the battery lasted for  hours this is not bad but i wish the nokia had used a better battery for this phoneoverall this is the best phone one can get in the market now it is worth the money and you will not be disappointed i hope nokia does not stop to make symbian based phones now they have joined hands with mircosofti had bought this phone on   discount from amazon oneday shipment thank you amazon for this amazing offerupdate here is an update after  weeks of usage i am beginning to fall in love with this phone this is just fabulous especially anna i believe belle has not reached n america yet so i cannot comment on it i have looked at android phones but i do not like their small buttons and android ui is not as smooth as anna who said there are not good apps for nokia some of the apps that i use on e surprises my androidiphone friends if you are used to symbian you will love this business phonefinal update i am loving nokia more after nokia belle update it has  it is better than android certainly in speed i never had any glitches in belle even the battery seems to last longer than the previous software editions thank you nokia keep up the good work we would like to see more software upgrades similar to belle people who do not like nokia belle are perhaps used it for less than a week and gave a wrong impression about it,positive
good price for the quality,positive

excellent phone as advertised,positive
this is the best upcoming underdog smartphone on the market especially the company is from the us which means you can use the correct basebands of g lte if your in the statesid say the phone specs of real life use is between a galaxy note  s and maybe a note  i gave this phone to my relative and he has  he is blown away by the screen sizein hd quality i currently own a g and a note  and i would still buy one just to have theres somthing about it that makes it run pretty smooth maybe because theres no bloatware cellular branding and works with a crap load of carriers,positive
this was my best choice ever,positive
i love this phone and it was not as small has i taught it would be i am enjoying it,positive
my first iphone amazing still miss a few things from android but overall love the machine and os phone came in great shape despite being used,positive

upon my initial receipt i was unable to provide a thorough review as it was a christmas gift for my tween once activated on the tmobile network and given a chance to test it thoroughly voice email web and apps i have nothing but the best to say about this phone it performs great has great sound quality and has many great extras to play around with the screen is clear and smooth to touch commands i highly reccomend this phone in fact i ordered one for myself as it is a great deal vs having to pay a high price to upgrade with my carrier,positive

 for this phone was an absolute steallet us break this phone down part by part build you can not take the back cover off in order to expand storage the sim tray is located on the side of the phone however the aluminum body of this phone makes this phone incredibly sturdy in the hand the gorilla glass on the front is very smooth around the edges as the side of the phone connects to the front this gives the phone a very luxurious feel overall build score   for its nonserviceable design storage this phone comes in a cheaper gb model as well as a more reasonable gb model gb may be enough for most people but this phone is clearly designed for a more particular audience in mind this is where the gb model is more reasonable i currently have all the updates as well as over gb of music on this phone and still have  gbs left with the gb option i would be in a bit of trouble now that they offer a gb option however the score for this phone is bumped up a bit overall storage score  would be higher with expandable storage option display this phone sports a  inch display with a cgsbased lcd panel operating at a native resolution of x i must say this phone literally shines the display alone proves that this phone is a flagship device this may not be superamoled but with this quality it really does not need to be colors are absolutely beautiful and playing p videos from youtube shows how beautiful this display truly is the touch sensitivity is spot on and the viewing angles are astonishing overall display score  it could be superamoled but does not need to be at this price hardware this phone packs a beast of a processor the core snapdragon  with the adreno  gpu this phone can and will run anything you throw at it with ease surprisingly this thing does not overheat like most devices sporting this chipset at first it gets considerably warm but never to the point of worry surprisingly it got better over time with updates i can manage to play an intensive game on it for a considerable amount of time before it even begins to warm up and when it does heat up it seems to stabilize and remain at a constant temperature i am not sure what zte did to help alleviate the overheating issue but it worksfurthermore this phone packs a massive gbs of ddr ram any tech enthusiast will appreciate this feature especially those that multitask as this phone does so with ease overall hardware score  this device is already overkill in the hardware department battery this phone sports a rather average mah battery for the snapdragon  running within this i would have liked a larger battery however this phone can get you through the day with average use on the plus side this phone features quick charge  and i must say that it charges incredibly and i emphasize that fast overall battery score  it could be better given the highend hardware but is made up for in extremely fast charging time speaker this phone features a pretty impressive frontfacing speaker it does not have stereo speakers so do not let the mesh design fool you regardless for the one speaker it does have it sounds good and can get loud that has  that is about all i can say for this category overall speaker score  stereo speakers would have been nice with this design primary camera this phone packs an impressive duallense rear camera the primary lense being mp capable of taking very highres photos and believe me they look spectacular the focus on this camera is pretty good and the speed at which the camera operates is fantastic low light photos could be better however although still not nearly the worst the camera features a special bokeh mode as a result of its secondary although somewhat gimmicky omnivision mp lense located above the main mp lense the bokeh mode is a lot of fun to mess around with and with some practice you can pull off some professionallooking photos the manual mode offers a ton of adjustable settings to toy around with to help capture that perfect shot when you have the time otherwise the auto mode does an extremely good job at taking quick photos on its own as a side note the adjustable dualled flash works great as a flashlight and can be extremely bright overall primary camera score  there are a few flagships that give this camera competition but those phones cost  times as much front camera the frontfacing camera comes in at an impressive mps however this number sounds more impressive on paper than it actually turns out to be in practice in day to day use the selfie camera as many will call it is average it is by no means terrible but it is not quite the best put in a phone as of right now however it certainly gets the job done and can pull off some decent photos in good lighting conditions overall front camera score  it takes decent photos but does not match the specs of the rest of the phone in practice video yes i am separating the video capture from the primary camera i have seen time and again lacking video on phones that take decent pictures this is simply not the case here this phone is capable of taking very crisp k videos at fps without a hitch run it in p and you can capture video at fps that framerate leaves room for a feature that is becoming more common in flagship phones slow motion capture and boy does this phone capture slow motion well many phones even flagships feature slomo capture but have a little lag in the final output that is not the case at all here jump in the camera and you are ready to take a smooth video at fps to be processed in slomo for your enjoyment and it looks buttery smooth easily competing with the likes of the newest iphones something that cannot be said for most devices in this category you can also take pictures while capturing video which is a nice touch overall video score  it can always be better software this phone runs android  out of the box but within two updates offers an upgrade to android  so far i have had nothing but a wonderful and smooth time with this os no hitches no glitches nothing it was a seamless transition i advise anyone that buys this phone to upgrade to android  the moment they boot up the phone and connect to wifi bloatware was kept to a minimum and the  or  gimmicky apps they include can easily be disabled right from the start what we are left with is a nearstock android experience ensuring that the core processor and gb of ram is ever more overkill than it needs to be this has been the smoothest android experience i have ever had overall software score  finally a company follows the trend that makes the nexusmoto series so successful but with overkill hardware to top it off audio input this phone features an impressive ak dac used to help your headphones pull off a more dynamic sound as such this phone is an extremely good music player the included jbl e earbuds are the best i have ever seen shipped with a mobile device period in fact i prefer them over my  soundmagic e earbuds which are pretty good on their own i can definitely see why these earbuds retail at  jbl has been in the audio business for quite some time and as an audiophile i can confirm that it shows in the stock earbudsregardless marketing the dac as bit capable is gimmicky at best as literally no one will be able to hear the signaltonoise ratio difference between that and their standard bit playback bitdepth does not necessarily mean better audio resolutionaccuracy where this thing really shines is in its ability to amplify your headphones it is clear that this is the absolute best sounding smartphone ever developed from a dac standpoint the dynamic range from an objective standpoint wipes the floor with other flagships and there is solid science behind this claim the thd total harmonic distortion is also lower than the other flagships literally no phone competes in the audiodac category overall input audio score  there is no phone that competes periodsummary who is this phone for everyone that wants a flagship phone that does not want to jump in on the latest hype of the likes of samsung or apple do i recommend this phone it is impossible for me to not recommend this phone you must absolutely buy this phone if you have the money it makes you wonder why other flagships cost so muchand yes the moto x finally has tough competition that is not from oneplus,positive
it has  it is my d,positive
i ordered it for my wife and she loves it,positive
best phone i had just not very much memory,positive
the best phoneworth the price,positive
just as advertised no issues experienced at all,positive
the best phone i have ever had  well with the exception of the iphone i guess  but i am loving this phone so much even how it looks and feel and so colorful it is a great product hands down ,positive
i want to say with not too many reviews for this company i was skeptical about purchasing the iphone s from them but i took a chance and when i received the product so quickly i was amazed on how quickly it was shipped to me also want to add that the iphone s i had received is awesome with a great price thanks,positive
for the price this phone is great it is nexus google made has everything up to a fingerprint only thing is the battery that does not last long yet again can not brag for the price of it still have the phone only problem is  gb is not enough at all,positive
everything seems to be ok with this unithowever for a smartphone with a lot of features like this one it would take more time of usage to determine if the product has problems or notregarding the shipping everything went as expected,positive
great international phone sent over to my family in australia works a treat very good for the price if you are looking for a basic smart phone runs apps smoothly nice feel finish and bright screen very average camera adequate batter life perfect size and weight no need to spend on moto g in my opinion,positive
for me the best in technology is sony,positive
it has  it is updatable to android ,positive
cute heavy duty case love otterbox,positive
okay just so you know i am what you might call an early adopter in other words i am a sucker for smartphones every time somone came out with something new i just had to have one for my own ever since i brought home my brand new first generation iphone i have always been enthralled with these little magical rectangles made of metal and glass i have had every iteration of iphone right on up through the s i have had three htcs including the amazing m and m i have owned a oneplus one an lg v a samsung galaxy s edge and i still use my s edge as a back up phone but i can honestly and unequivocally say that not a single one of them hold a candle to the xperia z premium the k display is amazing of course and the camera is incredible but what makes this phone stand out is that every little feature that it has works flawlessly i liked my galaxy phones but both of them would heat up lock up refuse to connect to my car via bluetooth refuse to charge the list goes on on the other hand the iphones worked perfectly but the uncustomizable ui just became so damned tedious after a while enter the z premium it has none of the cartoonish color saturation and ui of the galaxy models that the tekkies fawn over the z premium just has a k display that is smoother cleaner perfectly colored and blows your mind when you watch k media anybody who has ever seen a sony bravia hdtv as compared to a samsung will know what i mean the sony makes the images look like they are recorded on smoothsilky mm film while the samsungs images pop out but look like they are recorded on soap opera videotape moreover every single little feature that glitches or lags or freezes the samsung the z premium handles without even breaking a sweat the z premiums hardware feels premium in the hand and it has  it is solid minimalistic thin bezeled design is pure art oh and did i mention that it has  it is water resistant yeah customizable too i read somewhere that the samsung galaxy s is the lamborghini of smart phones let the kids have their lamborghini i will happily keep my aston martin xperia z premiumsony xperia z premium dual e  mp gb smartphone  international version  no warranty black,positive
well i did pay for a brand new phone but i got a refurbished one however upon negotiation with the seller they agreed to refund the difference to the average refurbished price found on amazon the refurbished phone had a few problems but they were quickly sorted out by the customer service very prompt and helpful service merit the overall purchase  stars but contact with the seller is recommended before final purchase to verify the product is as advertised as they say caveat emptor i would buy from them again,positive
thanks,positive
the phone is prefect sadly i got a bad phone do not order from the bluedot sim slot did not work waste of money but anyway the phone is great one con tho the battery life ,positive
great mix between blackberry and android not only does the phone provide a near stock android experience it adds some intangibles such as the physical keyboard for precise typing along with with top notch security and productivity apps aside from that a great screen for watching media and surfing the web phone is a top pick for ,positive
good for the price,positive
ok so i just got it yesterday but so far i love it great screen size and it is fast i can customize everything and its so easy to use love it,positive

this is a well constructed colourful handset with some excellent technological features windows phone is maturing nicely and the  has got a really palatable price point to boot it has  it is been overshadowed by others in the range but that does not mean it is not still a class act very good and nice device if you want to upgrade your old phone for me i received all the benefits i was looking for attractive design microsd support great screen and powerful camera,positive
phone works great receives incoming calls makes outgoing calls basic text and that has  that is about it perfect phone for whenever you need to ground your kids from their smartphones i remove the sim card and use a sim adapter to fit the smaller micronano sim cards in smartphones to the larger sim slot your kids will hate it,positive
awesome phone for the price  all of the blu phones are great and i strongly recommend them we have s for the kids and my wife and i have s and we love all of them best values on the market  equal quality to any well known brand,positive

phone was the talk of the store,positive
if you want to save money on the purchase of an expensive cell phone this is a good buy it comes with a battery charger and usb cable and had i not known i was buying a used phone i would have thought it was new free shipping is a plus also i will certainly consider this source again next time i am looking for a cell phonethe phone is unlocked so can be used with the sim card of any service supplier whether in the us or outside i purchased this as a gift for someone in the dominican republic and there was no trouble getting service from a local supplierthe phone requires a micro sd card if you want to save music and photos etc that does not come with the phone so should be purchased at same time unless you already have a card you can move from another phone,positive
i bought this for my father who just needed a basic phone he loves it it works well and att had no problem helping him set it up as written by others the manuals are fairly useless and are written in a microfont they do not have all of their manuals on line but i managed to find one close enough that i was able to email him and he used that so overall the product is great but the documentation not so much,positive
it has  it is very good,positive
it is a great watch i have loved it and had no problems ever since i put it on,positive
awesome thanks,positive
it has  it is really good,positive
i love this phone and wanted to replace it i did and im very pleased with it it works perfectly,positive
everything perfect thanks,positive
first i will say that the s is an awesome phone i really love the featureset i would highly recommend getting it this review will mostly be about my experience trying to buy one this is my th attempt to get an s that was as described i tried  times on ebay doing my homework on the sellers but they were all flawed in some way screen burnin screen color partially tinted gps not working etc this was my second attempt on amazon the first one was obviously a refurb and the fit and finish was off no way that thing was going to be water resistant i looked into seller ratings and wanted a new s so far everyone indicated they were new but they were clearly not they didnt even have the decency to sell a product that could fool someone to think it was new this time i went with topshelf direct as my seller and this one is actually new or darn well close enough to fool me and is functional and clean no doubt use these guys if you can,positive
purchased phone aug th  october th phone stopped working cannot even charge it past  return date was fixed by cv remote htc reset thank you,positive
the phone is brand new delivered in the original sealed retail box motorola has said that the  moto x will be upgraded to android  lollipop and motorola said they will roll out as many moto x  software features to the moto x  as the  models hardware will support at  for this  gb developer edition this is a really good valuethe white back of this phone looks like it is a rough cloth fiber material however it is not rough at all it has a translucentiridescent look like carbon fiber and is smooth like the surface of carbon fiber i had no problems using the phone on cricket wireless other than the sim that the store clerk uses to test for compatibility did not work with my phone i went ahead and purchased my own cricket wireless sim from the store registered it with my phones imei number and it had no problems connecting to the cricket networkcricket wireless uses atts network and it currently offering  gig of data for  a month by using autopay unlimited voice and texts,positive

deliver faster than expected excellent conditions and very nice packaged love it,positive
i was nervous that my phone was not new when shipped the reason is because it came in an att little box not the original box show online the only complaint i have about this phone is that i did free shipping with amazon it was to be at my address within   buisness days it took  weeks it seemed i waited forever but i give the phone  stars because of the product it works great on g lte go phone network it also takes great video and pics i have not transfered my pic to the computer yet i bring this up because some reviews said pics looked great on the phone but not on a computer due to the phones enhanced hd technology it also has smart options such as will text a caller while you are driving i have not got into the special features on the phone like the smart features i have only done the basics google play web browser facebook etc but in all the phone has been great and i recommend this phone looking for a good phone,positive
just great it came and was in perfect condition  looked brand new ,positive
this is a review for smguzkaxaa the only noncarrier based samsung us warranted factory unlocked phone too bad amazon lumps all the unlocked s reviews together this was very confusing as i gradually figured out that numerous overseas and carrier based versions of the s exist i will not waste time reviewing the phone itself other than the primary differences that this version has  it is has both cdma and gsm receivers optimized for the bands and channels used by us carriers in the us sprint verizon and us cellular use cdma att and tmobile use gsm ie  it is theoretically compatible with any us carrier allowing you to take your phone to any us carrier including the pay as you go services such as cricket boost virgin etc set up flawlessly on my cricket account it does not come preloaded with carrier bloatware although samsung does load some of its own that cannot be removed the most irritating being samsung pay which occasionally generates popups reminding you its available it is warranted by samsung with full us warranty no battery issues on the s but nice to know it has  it is warranted if something similar to the note  debacle happens updates are pushed out directly from samsung presumably at a quicker pace than from many experience from carrier versions i have received one update so far in  days,positive
i always wait to review things until ive had them at least a month i bought it as a fathers day gift for husband and he loves it we are partial though as we gave up apple products a couple years ago and are now  loyal windowsmicrosoft fans but if the phone was crap believe me i would say it so you would be spared the purchase the only thing is he is not able to open up pictures he fully believes that is an issue with him not figuring out something and not a default with the phone,positive
i thought i gonna have earing kit but no the phone is good before i was using xperia z this one is just perfect,positive
very satisfied with my purchase,positive
better than expected iphone was exactly how it was described if not better,positive
seller provided timely deliver and the product was as expected,positive
great phone however my granddaughter dropped it but we are planning to buy another works great quality is great,positive

ive been meaning to get a new iphone and since i got a job i finally got a major upgrade from a s to a s plus i love this iphone and the color is so fabulous just like me i always told myself the bigger the phone the better my life is,positive
product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use,positive
very nice fast shipment thanks,positive

exactly what i wanted the price is right and the quality is awesome,positive
love this case would recommend to anyone it has  it is slim yet tough it handle falling into a pig pen and survived,positive
very happy with phone no issues at all,positive
ya know for the price this is one sweet phone i mean if you are the kind of person who is obsessed with the latest greatest ubertech you are not gonna be satisfied with something that is not riding the bleeding edge but i got this for my kid because id gone the cheapo route last time we had an upgrade with att and those freebie phones were just not cutting it they were barely even functional anymoreand then just when we were anticipating an upgrade for them in december and id promised them that att went and changed our upgrade cycle to  months making us wait until may to get new phones i was not gonna let att make a liar out of me so i came to amazon in search of something that will hold them overwell im not even sure im going to upgrade in may now because i might let the lines go offcontract and look for a better provider my son loves this phone granted it has  it is only been a few weeks and sometimes problems show up later but so far so goodstuff i really likememory is upgradeable via sd cardi was concerned we might have to order a minisim since my boy had the oldschool bigger chip but went to the att store and they used a thing that looked like a stapler to punch his sim to the smaller size quick easy and free fixthe color is niceso far performance seems greatprice was reasonableother stuff worth mentioning you get  screens to put your desktop shortcuts for apps on some phones have more  is enough for us but your mileage may vary,positive
i guess i am just easily pleased but i do not detect any lag in this phone going to lte increased download speed from about  mbps to over  with symmetric upload also  mbps instead of  great display power on the bottom where it belongs  has some issues but they are not related to this phone why does android require adb and a development install on my pc to get the numeric battery level on the notifications bar again not the phones fault phone implements  well with little clutter the only real issue is that it may be too big for me it sticks out of the back pocket of my jeans and i need to cut the buttons off the pockets of my dress pants if i am going to carry it in them otherwise all good phone comes with a case screen protector earbuds and charger,positive
this watch is cool for the price it is worth every penny it is hooked to everything in my phone although i could not figure out the browser i dont think they even made it to work instead of looking up bt notification apps in the play store wait until your watch arrives and turn it on scroll through and you will see an app qt scan it and the app works flawlessly i can connect to my phone from the watch with this app all the other apps never worked so do not waste your time as for the looks it is amazing not too bulky or uncomfortable sleek and the touchscreen works great,positive
best case for an iphone i work construction and i drop it all the time and it still works great,positive
awesome phone this phone is snappy and can handle doing multiple things at one time without slowing down i have had it for over a month and it has not done anything out of the ordinary battery life is phenomenal especially with the stamina mode on camera is sweet this is a phone i can trust nothing about it seems fishy it has  it is fast and reliable and fits in my hand much better than those giants that are passing as normal size phones nowadays thank you sony ,positive

bought this for my grandfather wanting something basic that he cannot mess up and that is exactly what this is very easy to use slightly flimsy but it has  it is a  phone so no sweat do note you will need a micro sd card to be able to take amd save any pictures,positive
the large screen is not p but it has  it is still excellent for watching hd video i have not had any problems with lagging either tremendous battery life and a micro sd slot for storage make this the ultimate flying companion i watched a full length movie on a recent flight before renting a car at the airport and driving for   hours using the phone as my gps without plugging it in there was still plenty of battery life left when i arrivedother notable features include settings to limit apps access to your mobile data and an fm tuner the tuner requires the use of headphones the wire acts as the antenna finally the device does not limit the volume using headphones you can turn it up to uncomfortable levels if you like overall great device,positive

i love this phone this is my second blu studio phone i cannot stress enough what great phones they are we were with sprint for years and they just kept going up in price i thought this was okay because i got to get good quality phones for free i finally woke up and switched to straight talk i only pay  a month and because of blu studio i get top quality phones at a fraction of the price this one has an amazing camera and even the front facing camera takes great clear photos seriously how can they sell this gem for under  you will not be disappointed,positive
and this one is no exception if you are looking for a phone but do not care for internet use or apps this is a sturdy one with good battery life and build quality it does have g a web browser music player gb microsd slot card not included and a camera all are usable and entirely capable however the experience is obviously lacking compared to more expensive smartphones the phone has ovi maps although no gps built in basically one can carry a map database of the entire world on a microsd card although location cannot be determined automaticallyphysically it is pleasant to hold and push the buttons the screen is not touch this is a great phone for those who do not need advanced features but still want an aesthetically pleasing and durable device that works everywhere,positive

i ordered the gig white nexus x after wanting to purchase the p and finally settling on the xdue to the ps size i expected a smaller phone definitely not complaining about the size though since the display is a definite improvement from my previous iphone  very slim easy to hold design only cons ive found is that it comes with a c type charger but i can overlook that since a usb adapter came along with it the other negative is that i was expecting to activate it with boost mobile and not have to switch my phone numberbut even though this phone is unlocked it will not work on boost mobile so heads up i decided to purchase a sim card from tmobile also there is only one front facing speaker even though it looks like there has  there is two of themso do not think that one of them is broken anyways love the finger print scanner and that the time is displayed whenever i pick up or move my phone without having to unlock it with a finger print pictures are top quality specially when using hdr and i will definitely not be replacing this phone any time soon,positive

ok guys heres the deal i put down my nexus  for  weeks to use this phone and i actually dont think im going back to the nexus  i also own a galaxy s and this phone is more responsive than the s i love the looks of the blu over the nexus  or the s when i say looks i mean the lay out and looks of the android version i wished we could have lte with these phones but i can get over  mbps on a good tower with g the battery life is great the feel is great i am defiantly not buying another high dollar phone again there is not much lag at all with this phone and it certainly does not get in my way also this phone has some perks to it like tethering out of the box works and the viewing angles are very good the backlight gives great coverage and i usually run it all the way on  at night during the day mid way is great crisp colors the camera is not bad for a  mega pixel looks better if u supply light with the dual led flash or take day time pics over all i love this phone over my nexus  and s,positive

i was a little hesitant about buying this phone simply because i had never heard of the company before but i am extremely glad i did buy it ive had it for about two weeks now and i am very impressed with how well the phone performs for the price it holds a charge fairly well takes decent pictures and all around works great the only issue ive had so far is that the wifi does not work very often but i think that may just be because i live in a college dorm and our wifi sucks anyways all in all though i would definitely recommend this phone,positive
shopping for a phone nowadays can be an incredibly complex headache there are so many things to consider from size shape color style performance specs etc my wifes number  criteria was style before we were about to switch carriers i showed her the phones i had used and recommended nothing caught her eye i thought i was going to be stuck paying full price for an iphone until i showered her htcs offerings she immediately took notice she admitted it had style and design props we were worried about the camera she originally bought the iphone off of the camera hype but it turned out to be fine i was worried about performance it being an older phone but it works without a hitch htc makes great phones that are optimized much more than others ive seen perfectly satisfied,positive
such a great phone no issues at all,positive
like i already said it has  it is a nice phone better than a lot of brand the resolution is awesome it makes that ive ever been expected this one is the best brand better especially than i you know what it is boom eklate,positive

ive been using my classic for more than two months and im very happy with it ive been a blackberry user for more than a decade and ive never been tempted by my families migration to the iphone the classic has an almost identical size profile as my husbands iphone  ill take the physical keyboard over the larger screen my last blackberry was a  and it looks like a brick in comparison to the classic the transition from the bold to the classic was intuitive  no hasslesi use the phone mostly for email and web browsing checking in on facebook  works great for all of these the preloaded map is easy to use and works well both for finding locations and providing directions i like the camera and the video functionsthe first phone i received had a problem with keyboard back lighting amazon made the return exchange very easy,positive
great for the price perfect protection,positive
good phone for traveling abroad none of the big bells and whistles of a typical smart phone but extremely functional small light with excellent battery life we used this little phone while traveling to france and since it had  sim slots we could have both us and international coverage well worth the price and it functioned well,positive
looks and works just as said fast shipping thank you,positive
ill probably not need anything more than what the phone currently offers the shape and dimensions of the phone can be improved i was looking to get an iphone but the camera on this is definitely a decisive factorcompared to the iphone i would say internet browsing is still a plus for the iphone touch screen that is bigger however you can get what you want from this phone when it comes to browsing the net the camera on the iphone can not match this camerait seemed strange to me why the black version was  more expensive and popular than the silver one which raises the question why make the silver version,positive
very good product grandson is very proud of it,positive

id used an ipod for my calendar and email needs since i was around wifi all the time that changed so i got the new moto x phone after giving android a good several months i just could not take it anymore i had to go back to apple something as simple as good email and calendar apps are a must for me and androids apps for those are simply awful do not get me wrong there are some things i liked about android over apple but in the end i hated picking up that moto x because i got so frustrated using itafter going back to apple the only thing i miss from android is the period button on the keyboard and the ability to hold it down in order to select common punctuation characters quicklyi love my iphone and the price from amazon warehouse deals was the cheapest by far and it was practically brand new,positive

i received my new blu vivo  smartphone  days ago and i could not be happier with it the g lte is working perfectly for me since i have phone service that uses tmobiles lines i immediately dialed a friend to check out the sound quality my friends voice was crystal clear and she assured me that i sounded great on her end as well although the  inch screen is gigantic compared to the size of my old windows phone my vivo feels so light weight and easy to hold to the ear i was concerned that such a large phone would feel awkward to hold but with how thin the phone is it actually feels much more comfortable to holdit took me a while to decide to go with the vivo  since my other choice the blu life one x has the x screen resolution compared to the vivo s x however the super amoled display is very sharp and the colors are so vivid i can hardly resist picking it back up just to look at the gorgeous screen next i had to try out the camara due to low light conditions my first photo was less than satisfactory but i discovered a setting just for low lighting and tried again much sharper and the focusing was not even too bad either despite my hand tremor ill need to take more photos but already i can say that the colors came through a hundred times better than my last phonei am no techie so trying to set up my phone in a way that i could avoid having to search for my favorite apps or phone contacts i went searching for a new launcher before buying my new vivo  android phone i did not even know what a launcher was for the short message is you must have a new launcher there are so many great launchers out there that i had a hard time choosing and even watched youtube videos to decide i went with a fairly simple yahoo aviate launcher i am so glad i did on my home page i can swipe up for my favorite phone contacts to pop up having easy access to my family phone contacts is essential for me also i can put as many of my favorite apps on the home page as i like swipe right and on my next screen aviator has presorted my apps into categories such as social music news and more swipe to the left of the home page and i have news and info specifically chosen for where i am and the time of day the yahoo weather is right there for a quick look at radari am very picky about new purchases but this vivo  phone has met my every expectation the only slight complaint has been the phone case that came with the phone overall it does the job and will be fine until i can purchase a better lasting case but at first i had trouble plugging in my head phones it seems that the hole in the case for the port was just a tad small i switched over to my favorite ear buds that are less thick where the jack plugs in and it has  it is working better for me oh and the built in fm radio tuner is a pleasant surprise you can only use it with the head phones plugged in since it works as the antennae but that has  that is the only way i listen to music with my phone anyhow the radio reception sounds great on the phone several times a day i make a new discovery of features that i have been missing out on with using an outdated windows phone the ok google feature is the coolest thing ever i can tell google to email my husband a grocery list or reminders without ever touching the keypad some of you who have not been deprived of fun android apps may be snickering at me but i am having the most fun with my new blu vivo ,positive
i like it becouse the price is razonable,positive
this phone is amazing works very good and screen is giant almost as a tablet the back buttons are where must be in all phonesgreat phone,positive

great value if you are looking to find a cheap unlocked phone to avoid getting locked into a contract or pay monthly fees to purchase a phone though your provider i moved off of att to cricket after the phone i was paying for broke and i had to finish paying for it before i could purchase a replacement could not be happier only negative that does not impact me at all is that the camera is not great otherwise is strongly recommend this phone,positive

after reading several reviews i decided to buy the phone and test it out i activated on att network and all the apns were automatically setup i am getting glte speeds just like other reviews stated it does not have an app drawer i tried to use the google launcher but did not like the functionality i instead opted for nova launcher and really like the options it gives to customize i tried to download apps from the amazon app store but it kept causing my phone to crash to i stuck to just downloading apps from the play store there has been no lag even when running several apps at once it does have a great speaker that is really loud,positive
really nice phone it work pretty good,positive

i ordered this phone as a christmas gift to my son i was a bit hesitant as this would be the first phone i purchased outside the carrier cartel the pricevalue side of me had a hard time believing a phone could perform well be made from quality materials look awesome and be cheap at the same time i had been well suckered by the belief that only apple samsung htc etc made quality phones i am happy to say i was wrong big time and a sucker nevermore shall i be for starters believe the camera hype it really is as good as an iphone see the pic my son took with his truly amazing then how about getting every accessory you could want right in the box charger and cable of course but then add a case screen protector and even headphones which actually are not  am not that bad combine that with a good processor and ram ok memory expandable though and a  price tag and you have a winneronly one small issue for us personally apparently this will not support wifi calling even if your carrier does despite some answers to the contrary above this is according to blu support and tmobile my carrier it affects us as we travel somewhat regularly to an area with no coverage and without wifi calling the phone becomes just a small tablet but that feature is not worth  more i would have to spend for a comparable samsung or htc phonebad reviews here i just do not get them either haters or those who perhaps received a lemon its electronics that happens sometimes but at least blu is a us based company and support should i ever need it should not be too big of a hassle and heck if the phone fails after a yearoh well just  to get another one still money way ahead of the carrier cartels phone pricesthe other seller my son  and most of his friends tout around  galaxys and iphones i was pretty worried about him having some phone shame but he is thrilled with it and proud to show it off especially the pictures and video kudos blu keep working to dispel the belief we have to spend  to have a good phone i am a convert my vivo  xl is on the way,positive

this is a really good phone and i really sturdy phone i dropped it a lot and it has never cracked or broken and the screen does not have any kind of malfunctions the only problem ive had with this phone is that my son got a hold of it and he somehow made me my apps disappear from the back of my background and now i cannot get them back i cannot find them or anything that has  that is the only problem ive never experienced this with any other phone so i do not know how to fix it,positive

i have had this phone for about a week now and so far it works great i was afraid it would not be as fast because it has an earlier version of android but that is not the case i hardly have trouble with this phone it does not lag as expected from phones with earlier android versions i am still considering whether to update or not since it is working so well for me as it is internet is fast apps run smoothly and i can make basic phone calls and text i have taken few pictures with it and have not explored all of the settings yet to see how well it works but i am not expecting professional photos it is after all just a phone in that case you might as well just use a regular camera,positive

the most cost efficient way of getting a great smartphone ie get last years model for about  bucks it has  it is fast it works it has  it is unlocked and even though the seller did not sell it that way it appears to be brand spankin new even the power plug and the usb cable were still in their factory wrappers not a single scratch and although this model is verizon banded i use the tmobile  dollar a month plan  gigs lte  minutes unlimited msgs which is unbeatable available only through some wallmarts i took it over to tmobile and was told a similar offer from att on this phone would have been a problem because they lock their phones down  even when they say it is unlocked and id have to contact att for unlockingive noticed that lte on tmobile is not consistent enough to use where i live so i use the hspa utms option if you select the lte it eventually goes down all the way to g and edge however using the legacy lte is the way to go when using tmobile as you will almost instantly kick down to the available frequencies if lte is not available most likely you had  you would be using bwtn g and hspa to get to this setting use settings  mobile data  preferred network  and you shall  you will have three choices the most flexible is ltelegacy gpp mode which gives you a choice of gsmgprsedge only mode umtshspahspa only mode or lte only mode umtshspahspa provides the flexibility and most continuous connectivity i needalso although i am not using verizon as my carrier connecting this sucker to a windows computer allows you to get all the upgrades via a verizon app i am quite happy with this purchase and i have also purchased a powerbear battery case on amazon for protection and lots more battery life  two days ago it was  bucks today i see it is around go figurereal life with the screen ok yesterday i inadvertently pushed it off a table an it landed face down onto a concrete floor about  and a half feet or so as i turned the phone over expecting to see a shattered screen i was elated to see a screen with not even a single scratch on it apparently this gorilla glass  standard works pretty good  so glad about that,positive
arrived quickly and as advertised,positive
as with all samsung gear products great job ,positive

great phone just as advertised no issues at all,positive
while ive only had this a few days so far it has  it is far better than i expected a few notes about some issues users report the phone as of  did not work on metropcs so save your time at least not in my area tmobile and att are fine i believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs that has  that is incorrect it will work on any network that accepts unlocked gsm phones the usb charger is not hard to work around all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug take a hardware store razor blade and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part it has  it is really not difficult and there has  there is no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable i just cut away at about a  degree angle and a standard cable fit fine the case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other without this cable mod the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable with it it has  it is fine standby battery life is quite good but when you use it for anything the battery drains fast but that has  that is why it only weighs  grams you cannot expect a tiny battery to have a long life that has  that is not realisticthis little phone is amazing they have actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingersin terms of size this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone i havei cannot think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc and for me i prefer this small size i almost never carry my full sized smart phone because i just do not like that sizei will not know for a year how durable this thing actually is but honestly at the price i do not even care if it fails you can buy  of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy and they are not  am not nearly as adorable,positive
it has  it is great,positive

stop if you have decided on a smartphone and are about to order take a breath  read my review on the blu life  xl you will not be sorry you read my review i researched this s phone and found its specs very impressive it took me all but hrs with it before i knew this was it the one what caught my eye in the specs before i got it was the gb internal memory it has a problem with most s phones most only with  gb internal mem i use a lot of apps and it didnt take long to fill the storage up i thought id use the sd expansion to take the apps i couldnt fit on the internal mem but to my disappointment the sd card didnt accept most of the apps for some reason i have  gb sd mem in my blu life  and it let me transfer a lot of the apps keeping my internal mem hardly used i love it its core cpu  gb of ram is not joke that leads me to the hd screen quality   view of my videos its g supported and im getting it it has hotspot which lets my get wifi on my tablet if i need it it seems they did some improvements on the voice  speaker phone since my blu studio so in short its fast has a brilliant hd screen plenty of storage g capable  lets not forget a sharp mp front camera  a high capacity battery whats not to like my question to you is what are you waiting for order the blu life  xl now,positive

phone was easy to set up works as i expected with one nano sim card one micro sd card the switch to a phone with only software keys and with its power button on the back was initially somewhat disorienting for someone previously used to the samsung galaxy line but is now just as easy to usecamera seems fine though im not particularly invested in photography so not very savvy there music playback is great which i do care aboutbattery life has been pretty reasonable in the past month ive been using it ive had a couple days where i do get through the entire battery in the day but this is on days where im actively using the phone pretty much the whole day battery life is definitely fine on standby so most days being out of the house for  hours i still have charge at the end of the dayvisual quality is really good on the phone as well when looking at other phones side by side i realize how much i appreciate the clarity of images on this phonebasically after a month of usage i have no complaints,positive

for those who do not want to read the full review read the tldr belowwith highpowered specs under the hood a beautiful  x  display a simple and elegant design android marshmallow almost out of the box and support for almost all gsm hspa and lte bands there has  there is a lot to be had for with this unlocked smartphone for not a lot of coin relatively the zte axon pro is a budgetfriendly beast that you will fall in love with if you give it a chancepros snapdragon  gb ram and gb internal storage support for most wcdmagsm carriers lte bands supports all of tmos frequency bands fyi volte support for carriers that support it band  for tmo carrier aggregration for areas and networks that support it band   band  for tmo ca support for att also wifi callingtexting confirmed on tmobile simple elegant design with a premium look and feel relatively affordable compared to other flagships with comparable specs such as nexus p oneplus two etc android marshmallow almost out of the box  updates once connected to wifi had me at  great dual lens camera that actually takes good pictures quick charge feature that can take battery from  to  in  minutes  year manufacturers warranty us model comes packaged with highquality jbl headphones that sound great with the phone capacitive touch buttons that allow full use of gorgeous p displaycons battery life is not the most optimal has gotten much better since  software updates to  and some settings tweaks signal sometimes drops for a second when switching frequency bands and is not always immediate to pick up new frequency signal is not always as strong as it should be on lte no doubletap to wake could be fixed in a software update only one frontfacing speaker albeit a powerful and clear sounding one some bloat apps preinstalled can be disabled but not fully uninstalled no expandable storageso i bought this phone to replace my oneplus one gb phone which was getting a little long in the tooth but the main reason it was replaced was that although the opo supported lte with tmobile and family mobile it did not support many of the lte bands i just recently went on a road trip and during driving anytime i got out of any large city the lte support would drop and i would go to edge or no signal meanwhile my wife who had the lg g stylo would have full lte coverage well this was kind of a dealbreaker and so after a lot of research and going back and forth between this phone and the huawei nexus p i finally pulled the trigger and bought this phone over the nexus p do not get me wrong the nexus p is a beautiful phone and i have for the most part loved the nexus devices and what they offer unlocked phone premium specs for an affordable price and the latest and most pure stock android experience but there are a couple reasons i chose this over the nexus p and oneplus twospecsthe zte axon pro has specs that may not be able to keep up with the flagships currently just coming out but it goes toetotoe with the big boys that released this past year and still comes out holding it has  it is own this phone comes with a snapdragon  same as nexus p and opt gb ram gb more than the nexus p gb gb internal storage for this model reviewed but also comes in gb flavor while the nexus p does come in all the way up to gb internal storage it will cost you much more than what this gb model is going for as of now it also has support for most us lte bands lte bands  which should give you a variety of options of network providers and mvnos to choose from when it comes to usabilitypricebang for buck factorwith the above listed specs i was able to get the gb ion gold variant for about  right here on amazon with free twoday prime shipping in comparison the nexus p is running about  usd here on amazon although i have seen it on sale on the egg for  for the gold variant previously but still have to pay shipping sometimes likewise the oneplus two has just recently been reduced to  for the gb variant but you have to pay shipping anyway you will be hard pressed to find a phone with these specs for this price and if you do not need the gb storage internal you can always opt for the gb version which is now running for about  as of this writingperformancesince i have fired this thing up it connected right away although i had to manually set the apn settings to get proper data connectivity with family mobile tmobile mvno signal has been overall clear and call quality good even with many apps open this thing does not miss a beat no stutters hangs or crashes no overheating issues that i could detect although it did feel a little warm upon first start up after first update no more warmness battery life can sometimes leave something to be desired on moderate use but once updated to android marshmallow  and one change to wifi settings set to turn off when asleep battery life has gotten much better and i can make it through the day until the evening one one charge even with some moderate use web surfing streaming music and some playing games this is even if i unplug the phone off the charger the evening before instead of the morning of again battery still leaves something to be desired but it can be expected somewhat due to a large p display and a powerful chip powering this thing also even when battery life is depleted due to heavy use it is offset by having quick charge feature when using the supplied wall charger i found from testing the provided wall charger will get the phone from  to  within  minutes dependent on the features i have turned on in the background wifi etc i neglected to mention that in my original review but a commenter mentioned it thanks btw and i wanted to add the extra info close to stock android interface and not much preinstalled bloat ensures this thing runs smooth driving across from las vegas to utah this thing maintained overall constant connectivity and data streaming with music for most of the whole trip although there was a brief second when switching frequencies that the phone dropped connectivity and when i had one small dead zone the phone took a while to reconnect i do not know if this is normal or a cause for concern and if so then i will return the good news is there is a year warranty if the phone stops working then they will repair or replace at no cost to me for extended coverage if within  days of purchase it is defective i can get a full refund which is a comfort if within  days i have buyers remorse over purchasing this phone i can get a refund but i have to pay the cost of shipping it has  it is a peace of mind that helps when purchasing this device and adds value to the purchase unless something goes wrong with it i do not see myself returning itdesignthe axon zte pro has a premium look and feel that is comparable to the nexus p it has a slightly raised glass finish on the front and grill design on the top ear piece area and down on the single speaker which is actually quite powerful sounding the back has simple lines and design with an axon logo it comes in  colors which is a gold my model blue although it has  it is very dark colored and a silver i probably would have chose the pthalo blue or silver if they had  they would been in stock but the gold is actually quite nice to look at once you see it the rear has dual lens camera that works actually really well and has a fast shutter speed i was able to get some really good pics with it and my inner shutterbug started to come out while i was down on the vegas strip still hard to catch one of my sons in motion but he has  he is like a humming bird with how fast he moves there is also a dual flash on the back but i have not had to use it in auto mode the biggest shame is covering this thing in the hybrid armor case i purchased for this kind of covered up the neat design of the phone lots of internal storage for taking pictures and downloading music but bear in mind there is not any expandable storage which is one reason i bought the gb variant if you save most of your stuff to the cloud the limitation of storage is not much of an issuewell this review is getting longer than i expected and it has  it is getting late but just to wrap up this is a budget flagship that will go toetotoe with the best of them and comes out in the top three or so devices if you give it a chance you will find there has  there is a great phone to be had here for not a lot of coin it makes a few compromises no fingerprint scanner no expandable storage etc but if none of those are deal breakers than give it a try and you will not be sorry i am glad i pulled the trigger on this phone and would recommend the same to a friend or someone else i know i hope this phone and this company zte get a lot more attention and credit for what they have done here a solid flagship phone at an affordable price with timely software updates making a great daily driverupdate so after a week of use and a little more indepth testing a couple updates to some of the issues i was experiencing or thought i was experiencing and a weird random issue that happened today first regarding the belief that i was getting weak lte signal compared to my wifes lg g stylo tmobile branded phone on tmobiles network as comparing the cell phone signal status bar would show  bars on my lte signal whereas hers would show  bars of full bars after doing some in depth testingcomparison within the native settings and within a free app called lte discovery great app btw i found my signal strength was just as strong if not a little stronger than my wifes lg g stylo upon refreshing network on both phones my phone ranged from  to  dbm lower is better while my wifes phone was  to  dbm as i said before my data reception has been good as well as call quality datasecond as time has gone on since the android  and after turning wifi to turn off in sleep mode in the settings my battery life has gotten even better and a full charge will last me not only all day but  hours with lightmoderate use and until the evening when using heavily or playing games lightmoderate use includes web browsing streaming music and watching youtube videos when playing intensive games during heavy use the battery goes much faster but that has  that is to be expectedlast random issue that just came up was what i thought was initially a malfunction turned out to be after some research and reading the instruction manual was due to a dedicated camera button that i was unaware of being unexpectedly turned on while on the road due to my protective case and the phone mount where it was gripping said case so if you are going to mount the phone in a phone clip keep the area clear where the dedicated camera button is bottom right button below power button as i use this phone more i am really coming to like it even more if it had external sd cannot complain with gb internal storage though and doubletap to wake can be fixed with update zte this would be the perfect phoneupdates     after some lengthy road trips and torture testing with constant screen awake google maps running with gps location on and streaming music over lte data i average over  hours total screenon time if i charge it the evening before and take off charger around pm battery will last me until  pm towards end of work day on a single charge with web browsing music streaming etcafter recently switching to tmobile postpaid i can confirm personally volte is working on voice calls i made a couple calls while on g lte and signal remained on g lte while calling and during voice call whereas before on walmart family mobile it would switch to hspa during call and then back to g lte afterwards this also leads me to believe tmo is at least testing band  in my area also if you are not  am not a tech geek like me and do not know why you should care let me just say calls on volte are super clear and sound amazing they also come thru louder as well as clearer i was calling someone from outside and the person was inside a building and it sounded like i was right next to the person also tried wifi calling and texting and even on a mediocre hotel wifi hotspot call quality sounded pretty good texts can be sent on wifi as well this was not supported on family mobile but is on tmo postpaid so keep that in mind as i use this phone more i keep finding new features and things that make owning this phone even more awesome also if you are on tmobile postpaid and are looking for an affordable flagship phone that takes advantage of all the advantages the carrier provides band  extended range lte volte support ca band support wifi callingtexting etc getting this phone is a nobrainernote screenshot i uploaded was only edited to remove the personal information of the phone number but this is an actual screenshot from my zte axon pro while on a voice call showing still on g lte again if volte was not active it will switch to g hspa signal,positive
take it from me a huge android user bought traded s phones since  seen all the android os this phone yes smokes a s  the screen is as nice in its own sense very bright  the gb ram for  you cant beat it the camera is as good as every youtube video says typing is a lot like a iphone set up flawless no lag emui os skin is actually pleasant  nothing difficult about it at all if this phone has ois and a better video experience id give it star rating  id buy this a one plus  or axon  before i ever spend  againgreat job huawei,positive

honestly i read many review before deciding on this phone because my little sister had one and it would break on her a lot i decided this was the most probable phone for me as it was somewhat inexpensive compared to many other phones out there but you also still get good quality phone as well i also liked how you can still swap out the batteries because i normally kill the battery with multiple games running and web surfing so far i have had this phone for a month or so and it has not given me any troubles and perform flawlessly,positive

i have always loved the ios system but living on a budget that is not an option i have used android phones before and they were always slow and unresponsive i had been researching blu for a while and thought that this phones look was just up my ally and i would suck up having to use android well i was pleasantly surprised when i got this phonethe styling is fabulous it has  it is slim and light weight and the set up is just like the iphone the operating system runs smoothly and i have not had any freeze ups at all ive dropped it once onto the pavement and was afraid it would break the only thing that happen was a little chip in the corner of the plasticno screen crack or major body damage the only thing that im not enjoying is the lack of cases other than that i would highly recommend to a friend,positive
my son loves his phone no issues as of yet,positive

great producti think the good and bad of iphone s are well known and i will not dwell on them herei had an iphone s and wanted to upgrade to a newer model with more storage  gb and did not want to get iphone  since gb is discontinued on new models of iphone s from apple the only way to get it is through resellers like amazon i highly recommend amazon warehouse deals because you can return them if not satisfied i initially got iphone  and returned it without trouble this one i will keep because it works well and suits my needs,positive
fantastic very easy to use and has an excellent camera ive never used before the camera of my phones because photos were of very poor quality it has  it is different now the release device with fingerprint is great and s health that measures easily heart pulses and the daily physical activity is very good option to stay healthy,positive

this cell phone was easy to start up with verizon i bought this phone for my daughter who lives out of state so our family could stay connected my daughter loves this phone,positive
great phone better than what i expected thank you ao much for this great phone,positive
i bought this phone to use on the straight talk network while traveling i came to areas where the phone just didnt have any service or i would only have data or talk i called up straight talk they said that yes i was on verizon towers but i did not have verizon service so i then got a verizon sim card hoping that i will have better service still verizon but not technically verizon since there is an order to the calls and data based off of whether you are contract or prepaid i called att and asked if i could use their sim card in the phone they said i could but it would not work how it was supposed to so the cdmagsm statement in the title has me perplexed though there are settings within the phone that lets you switch between gsm and cdma so fingers crossed that in  days my phone works where it had not before i do not live on my phone it is just convenient to have to do basically everything on so straighttalk works though it does not work like verizon prepaid as verizon prepaid does not work exactly like verizon contract this phone being on a verizon contract would be the best option if you rely on your phone for everythingthe phone is great the camera is fantastic though the photos i take and videos can only be viewed on the phone since i do not own a k tv i have always wanted this phone now i have it hopefully for a very long timeupdate even with verizon as my prepaid provider i still can not make phone calls where a normal verizon phone can i have data but no voice the phone says extended service yet i have no servicei should have just stayed with straight talk and att instead of getting verizon prepaid we dont come here too much but this is the nd time in a month i can make calls with google dialer though i can not receive themalso with verizon prepaid everything extra is an upcharge i do get service at my mothers which i didnt get before with straighttalk att its just upsetting when you get something and are told by a verizon sales rep that it will work then a month later finding out it does not,positive
bought it for my mom and she loves it very easy to use and durable,positive
this is one of the best items i ever bought on amazon got what i saw receives item on time nice,positive

im happy i upgraded from nexus waterproof and good camera will allow me to retire my panasonic ts this will reduce number of devices i pack and eliminate the need for taking a ts picture for quality and a phone picture for public wifi email,positive
i purchased this to use while i was fixing my note  screen it ended up comparing very well better in some respects to my note the camera is of lower quality but not so much that it really made a difference to me it was definitely faster than my note  the only negative comment id have for this phone whatsoever is that when an update pushed through it started locking me out of the phone when i got a call a new update fixed that thoughalthough i am back to using my note  my husband is now using the zenfone and likes it just as much as i did if you are looking for an inexpensive comparable smartphone i would definitely recommend,positive
an excellent refurbished model like new a and i would definitely buy again from this sellerphone works better than my last note,positive
this is a phenomenal phone  big screen in a very small form factor  ir blaster which the z does not have  camera is great and the benchmarks test that i have run are fantastic and have beat every other phone i have put it up against iphone   gs  and one x sold my iphone  to buy this and i do not regret it a bit  if sony stays on top of software updates and releases them quickly it will be hard to beat this one,positive
i preordered this based on using the honor x figuring it would be an appropriate upgradei have preordered wisely packaging some people do not care i do and this packaging is really beautiful price i bought into the honor brand at  for my old honor x im not a big spender so the  for the upgrade to honor  was a bit of a stretch for my budget that has  that is  with a  account credit for preorder yeah after using this no buyers remorse it has  it is a keeper at this price point it has  it is a gem camera im not enough of a pro to know if the dual lens is much better what i do know is that i got a bunch of really great shots including many in low light campfire there are some functions and modes beauty mode did not make me beautiful btw so far ive only used the panorama mode and the filters for after im not big into filters and there are plenty of p apps for that but sure those are fun so even though im not a pro i can confirm that this camera takes fast pictures and they seem sharp with lovely colors the low light pictures were a bonus im hoping that i can depend on that more and more with quality insideevening shots software two things to say about the software first i have very little patience for bloatware and there was very little on this handset it was all tucked into a little folder out of the way no complaints one item which honor has on there which i love is the phone guard which i can use to block calls and control some privacydata flow second emui when i picked up the honor brand earlier in  i was going from an iphone and for me the emui is perfect it feels nearly identical to the apple ios which means there was almost no learning curve i have read some complaints about this on the internet but i have to be honest i just have not found out what they are whining about emui suits me just fine appearance the shiny and reflective surface is pretty neat in full sun very layered maybe next time around i will not get white when i ordered it white seemed like a good idea but now im wondering if black might have been a better choice handfeel my phone is in my hand a lot and i can get my thumb all over the display for onehand texting the really smooth glass finish all over the honor  is lovely to touch and i find myself taking the freebie plastic case off just to enjoy the slickness of the phone body nb this thing is slick by that i mean it has  it is slippery it wants to slide it wants to creep it wants to go with gravity the plastic case puts a stop to that calling i have only had the phone  days now but so far no dropped calls or anything like that i went camping over the weekend out along the coast just trees and ocean good reception all over that does that mean it has  it is a good phone or that att has good coverage either way good good memory i just popped in my sd card that ive been using done battery all day of heavy use for fri and saturday gps many photos watched youtube videos listen to music and checked the guardian news  times friday there was a lot of life left in the battery when i hooked it onto the power bank at our campsite on saturday by the end of the long day it was down to  this seemed great to me fast charging yes this is my first device with fast chargingi have not had a crisis yet where i was running out of power but i did notice that it fills quickly after just a few days im beginning to feel that fast charging should just be standard on everything usb type c sigh time to buy some adaptersim still in the honeymoon period loving this smartphone i expect i will begin to notice some things after ive used it a while but i can say that at the moment this is making me really happy and it has  it is a definite step up for me,positive

easy to carry responsive and fits our needs,positive
quality phone,positive
this phone continues to satisfy me the buttons are both accessible with one thumb making one handed operation a breeze also due to the fact that it has  it is not a giant phone the fingerprint reader on the back is super fast the android experience is super quick and snappy thanks to its minimalistic design and the camera on the back is great only complaint is the battery life and that it has  it is usb  typec which is only a downside because it has  it is not as common yet those two things set aside though the charging is fast on a usb  charger and cable lightning fast  to  in just over an houron the topic of battery life im a real power user streaming youtube and other videos almost all day that has  that is very taxing on battery life i usually have to charge it  and a half times a day other than that it has  it is a decent batteryi would very much recommend this phone to someone who is looking for a fast enjoyable android experience but does not want to spend as much money for a samsung,positive

ive had this phone for almost a month now and i love it i would recommend it to anyone i had the boost mobile before this phone and the phone i had was the lg stylo the phone is just a little bit bigger but this blu phone is so much better i have so much more room on this phone for my apps before i had like  or  apps total before id get that little thing saying my space was low ugh i was always having to download apps then uninstall over and over again it was a pain but now i have like  games my audible app with all my books my amazon kindle app with all my other books and of course my google books with more books i had none of those on my other phone to much space oh that was another thing to i could not use my memory sd card to save some of my apps to but im able to almost all them with this phone the only problems i have with the phone are not really problems for me the camera is not the greatest but it takes pictures and there decent also when i listen to music it is not as loud as i like it but i have an mp player so it has  it is fine anyway if your debating this phone id say go for it but like other have said it has  it is not iphone or galaxy but compared to the prepaid phones ive had this thing is way closer then any others ive had  lg volt lg stylo aquos crystal and i have had iphone galaxy s and s hope this helps,positive

 months ago i spent money to buy a hd tv after my wife nagged me everyday until i did it now i realize that my phone is not hd and i spend more time on my phone than my tv googling hd phones i did see a few at many price ranges but some were older and bulky i had a slim tv i wanted a slim phone logical enough right the posh mobile e was a direct match for my ideal phone and it came in about  under my budget which i used for an extra gb micro sd card happy i am and hd in the house and in my hand makes me a happy,positive

thanks good price,positive
received the phone yesterday and it is as expected i have not gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast runs cool and the display looks great even in direct daylight did not get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect i did not really care about or want the finger print scanner so i am not torn up about that the phone itself is understated chic i suppose its solid in the hand has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused herei am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone resolution and quality of output are on par with an htc one m the m has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a tidal account on the go has enough power to drive the shure srh to uncomfortable levels does not seem to mind hte ultralow impedance of the shure se although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the htc one m four hours of tidal streaming  cd quality seemed to eat about  of the phones battery driving the srh and the screen mostly off which i consider to be another solid showingespecially for the money i feel its quite a nice device,positive
great replacement phone for my daughter put in old sim card and it fired right up,positive

i love this phone easy to navigate great service easy to use and just the right size the note is too big for me but this is a great sizei would buy again but hope i do not need a new phone for years to come i am not one who needs a new phone every year ,positive
coming from a nexus  i had high expectations for an android device the nexus  offered a clean layout  vanilla experience companies have a load of bloatware and usually added features and functionality are synonymous with not as efficient deviceslg knew it was time to step up the game and i would not be surprised if they hand picked the developers for the g ive used the phone for roughly four months now and after my fair share of experience with the device id like to provide you with my own personal opinion im not trying to compare this phone with some other phone because there are a plethora of websitesreviews doing sopros clean layout i do not recall this device every lagging behind in terms of performance it has  it is snappy and i advocate lgs decision to deploy it with the snapdragon  processor i do not see any performance constraints camera  time and time again we hear about the gs superior camera quality what i hear do not as much is about the optical stabilization i was very impressed with the optical stabilization on this phone knock on feature  cannot live without it i use it more than the power button call volume  loud and clear voice quality removable battery  sd card  need i say more updates  some users of the h model europe have already received the  marshmallow updatesthings needing improvement speakers  works fine but could be better battery life  for example  current battery usage   h  min on battery screen time  hours  minutes at   root greenify among other things will allow you increase the sot users have reported up to  hours of sot but i have yet to test this out if you do not care about the size you can always install a higher capacity battery also if you have an additional battery you can quickly swap it out default wireless charging  needs a special case to charge wirelesslyive been highly satisfied with the lg g and would recommend it for anyone looking to buy a new smartphone in my opinion it is the best smartphone in the current market,positive
love this phone,positive
love the phone works alot better than my old samsung and has not caught on fire like the expandable memory and the replaceable battery wife can work it,positive
bought this as a back up until my np arrives and i must say im impressed for the price the gps seems to lose connection a lot but still really good phone oh and the battery is amazing better than my moto x ,positive

great phone a bit bigger than i expected but it works perfectly,positive
perfect items,positive
love this phone i have had it for a few months now and i do not regret the purchase one bit,positive
so after using this phone for a while now ive come to a conclusion that this is a great phone for the price i paid there was just a new system upgrade so the phone works faster and the video quality is awesome and also do not buy a phone case because it comes with one already in the box,positive
first off my old phone was a samsung galaxy s so that is what im comparing this one too after looking through many reviews i found that most the complaints for this phone were people did not like the battery life and the home screen app launcher the galaxy s had a liion  mah battery whereas the blu life pure as an liion  mah battery for me the battery life is not a big deal because i do not use my phone a whole lot for watching videos or playing games so far the battery has been just fine for meas far as the app launcher it was not my favorite looks like a iphone knock off all i had to do to fix this problem was go to the app store and install nova launcher it works great with the phone and is much better than the home screen look and feel in my opinionas far as the speed and responsiveness it is as least as fast or faster than my galaxy s no complaints there it is plenty fast the screen is very nice the hd looks good i have not played a ton with the camera but it appears to take decent pictureshad i paid  for this phone i probably would not have given it  stars because of the battery which is not all that bad and the app launcher however since this phone was only  when i bought it it is worth the money as far as the specs go you can pretty much compare this to a galaxy s which will cost you  unlocked you really cannot beat the price for what you get with this phone,positive
almost a year later and it works perfectly fine great buy,positive
what can say its a nokia it does what its suppose to do if you are in the market for a reasonably priced phone that can stand being handle ruff this is the phone for you os maybe outdated but it works,positive
this phone is awesome and the seller was awesome too i got my phone in two days it was not what i expected at all get size and i have not found one thing wrong with it,positive
i have always had confidence in otterbox and with this one also for my samsung galaxy  i looked for it on amazon thinking i could save a little money from cost in store but then i found out they came in camouflage and orange being an outdoorsman well i had to have it now being  more than in store cost still confident in the case and asked why i spent so much on the case it came before scheduled delivery by ups and i pulled it out of the box put it on my phone and threw the phone at the steel exterior door of the house went over picked the phone up and said that has  that is why you buy an otterbox i read reviews and do not understand some of the fit problems people are talking about everything is where it needs to be on this one i once ran over one of my older phone in a stone driveway with a semi was a little concerned when i was walking over to pick it up but it was fine wiped the tire tread marks off the back of the phone and went on i also dropped one climbing a grain leg it was also fine our cage starts  ft off the ground i was probably  ft above that knocked the whole holder off my pants pocket and it fell to the concrete was not worried climbed on up did what i needed to do climbed back down to the ground picked the phone up and it worked just like it always had clipped it back on those are couple of the extreme stories i have for otterbox and their product im sure ill be just a pleased with this one,positive

after a week of jacking around with straight talk i finally got the correct sim card to use which by the way is an att compatible regular sized sim cardalso called the minisim it has  it is helpful to know that this card is mm x mm after you select either att or tmobile you get to choose micro or regular sized sim for att tmobile only offers the regular sized sim they do not use the micro sim at least with straight talk they do noti downloaded the straight talk apn program but never could get it to work properly i had the settings already written down so it was easy to just do it myself if anyone has any questions about the apn settings feel free to ask while fresh in my mindthere has been no weirdness about anything on this phoneeverything works perfectly i just love the big screen and the way videos look i feel privileged to have gotten such a nice phone when ordering it from wireless experts they guarantee the phone as new and state what has  what is in the box they are also are partnered with amazon so i felt i made a good choice it has  it is true what they say about the battery using up a lot of juice im going to try some alternative measures to see if that helps the battery time will tell ill check back in periodically and let you know if it has  it is still going goodsee my update below this post about learning i had a  year samsung warranty on parts and labor,positive
great item love this kind of phones,positive

i was quite skeptical of smartphones because all my friends had them and they would always end up complaining about how there is not enough free space on their devices or that the charge constantly runs out i felt that i was better off with my normal phone without any apps and games my friends and i are quite compulsive gamers hence the massive load on their devicesbut when my old phone died i thought i might as well get a functional smartphone the htc one x immediately caught my eye ive read many previous iphone users reviews on this device and they all almost conclusively say that this phone is as good as if not better than the iphones so i went ahead and purchased itit has  it is been only two days but ive already had my mind blown away i know that it has  it is too soon to say anything but i can definitely say that the pros significantly outweigh the cons of this device firstly ill just get the cons out of the way the phone heats up i played fifa  for andriod on it for almost  hours straight and it did heat up noticeably but in the defence of the phone it is a very processor heavy game the temperature began reducing just moments after i closed the game thoughnow for the pros it is an amazingly powerful phone ive used a brand new samsung galaxy note  samsung galaxy s samsung galaxy s google nexus  and quite a few other smart phones my friends and i can easily say that none of them have been as fast and powerful in their processing capabilities as the htc one x it takes a little getting used to but the entire system setup is extremely ergonomic and userfriendly the graphics are really nice and sharp the htc sense  software is great ive heard that some people downloaded the swype software from the android play store but i do not understand why the htc sense input keyboard is amazing i loved it getting the phone to register on my windows  laptop was a bit tricky but when i downloaded the htc sync manager it automatically began to register on my laptop it may have just been the umpteen tries i put into getting it to register but either way in a matter of fifteen minutes i had managed to get my phone connected to my laptopso in conclusion i can say that i have thoroughly enjoyed my first smartphone for the first two days and i hope to do so for as long as possible i strongly recommend the htc one x to anyone who wants a good reliable and heavyduty smartphone with none of the frills of an iphone or a samsung phone it truly is quietly brilliant,positive
still learning but so far quite satisfied,positive

bought to replace my blu studio  c hd this is a tremendous upgrade lte mp camera android  etc i use net att network and i did have to order a net nano sim to use with this but it was only  on amazon i called net and ported my number to the new sim and it was up and running in about  hour lte is so much better than hspa and this phones octacore processor makes multitasking swift i woke up the second day with the device and the upgrade was waiting to take me from  to  another neat thing was when i ported my phone number the phone automatically received the correct apn settings from net i did not have to fool around with different apns to get my lte and picture messaging to workdisplaythe display is great for a p my old phone was an hd p display and the super amoled blows it away the color saturation might be just a bit to much but you can change that in the settingsbuild qualitythis is my first samsung device so i cannot compare to say another galaxy phone but this phone feels as rock solid as my coworkers iphone  the aluminum frame feels great and the textured back feels really nice the capacitive buttons work great and the physical buttons power volume home are very rigid and defined the home key is almost too hard to press but all in all it feels very nicely built the phone is very very light my wife could not believe how light yet sturdy it feels compared to her galaxy scamerathe mp laser autofocus camera was my main reason for upgrading my old phones mp camera was decent but absolutely nothing compared to this one i have not gotten to use all the features yet but it suits me for what i need wonderfully the front mp camera does pretty well for snapchat etcbatteryive only used this one day so it is hard to say since i have been on it so much more than a typical day but battery life may be a bit of a let down for some people i however can charge my device all day at work when i want to in my car and at home so battery life is not a dealbreaker in a phone to mesound qualitycall quality is a huge improvement over my old blu phone ironically i probably use this phone as a phone less than i do anything else but it has  it is nice to have great quality the sound out of the bottom speaker is decent and does not sound muffled or tinny with headphones it sounds extremely good i have no complaints theresummaryi am very happy with this purchase i purchased the phone new for  on amazon and it was shipped next day air with my regular prime shipping so that was nice i was contemplating buying this the lg g or the galaxy s i personally like a smaller phone so i went with this and it happened to be about half the cost of the other options so it was a nobrainer i would recommend this to anyone on a mvno such as net            battery display features build quality camera speaker call quality ergonomics processing power att bloatware overall,positive
the phone exceeded my expectations,positive

the sony compact series has always been my go to for an android phone because of the size and speed the previous compacts were based on the latest and greatest highest end chip set at the time of their releases when this phone was announced as having the sd  i was more than disappointed so i wrote the phone off i was not sure which phone to get so i bought an iphone  which lasted a couple weeks until i remembered how restricted ios was i then had three options for a smallish phone the honor  still a little large the google pixel expensive and the sony x compact i had all three within about a month i kept the x compact yep that has  that is right i gave up the greatest from google and a very premium made honor  the reasonnumber the feel and size are just right its just a joy to use and carrynumber  i immediately realized that this phone is just as fast as the z compact and im not sure what they did but this phone is silky smooth almost iphone like you have some hang ups like every other android like in the play store but overall i am really impressed with the performance that just shows that specs are not everything and there is something to be said for real optimizationnumber   price it was dropped to  when i bought mine compared to the pixel it has  it is half the priceim no camara guru so i cannot really speak on this too much but it does take some real nice shots in good light low light will not be the bestmany people are bashing because the phone is not waterproof but it does not bother meedit it has  it is frustrating when someone gives one star and is not even talking about this phone the x compact does not have a cover for the usb this proves that the reviewer is ignorant amazon needs to monitor these reviews better,positive
this iphone is snapy and fast the camera is ok but everything else is really good i made a huge research agaisnt the zen iphone from azus blue phones idol  by alcatel and also the galaxy s the galaxy s was good but did not hace as muchas storage or ram but the procesador and camera were better i would recommend this phone over any other within the same price also remember thatbit is bigger than an iphone  so it has  it is pretty big,positive
as described totally recommend the seller a,positive

six years later there has  there is hardly any point in writing a review for this phone but it was my first smartphone and what a fantastic device it was i still miss that keyboard which was so perfectly designed to handle thick thumbs typing within a tiny bit of realestatethe iphone eclipsed this little wonder and the symbian os was struggling with finding a way to be relevant and yet this phone still managed to be one of the best smartphones of its generation,positive
i upgraded from nokia lumia  to this nokia lumia  i love it  it has a micro memory card slot up to  also battery can be removed for new one has dual camera and flashalso it takes a micro sim card it has plenty of internal storage for downloading apps i downloaded around  apps and still have alot of internal memory left the phone came before the expected date and packaging was greati dont know if i said it before but i love my nokia lumia ,positive

nice phone,positive
i got this phone when it was cheaper than it is now  and let me tell you this is one f the best value for money items ive ever seen i was going to buy it just to experiment with roms and other nerdy androidy stuff but after using it i think this could be used as a daily item the fm radio feature is pretty cool audio quality is not bad at all and the speakers front facing position makes it better the screens ppi is not very big but images and ui elements are quite smooth peaking of which the whole user experience is smooth probably thanks to the gpu not having to manage upwards of  million pixels like my note  probably due to the  ghz dual core not beefy but powerful enough and partly due to the fact that this phone uses the stock well pretty much ui durability well id prefer not to drop it but i think it shall  it will survive some small fumbles the device feels pretty solid in hand the only downer is the camera at  mp it has  it is a good sensor but with no flash or autofocus this phone is not a good choice for a nightowl or anyone who likes to take closeups with superb detail and while some might not like the weight it has  it is not particularily light i find it nice as it adds a premium feel to it i will update this review maybe once i root the device and run some benchmarks and find what day to day usage is likeupdate well i ended up returning it after a couple of days because i got a bootloaderlocked version ended up buying an identical version but right from motorola it has  it is rooted and while it was not super easy it was worth it ive got it running a light weight version of the stock rom with little build tweaks,positive
my daughter is in love with her phone i love it as well screen is huge about the size of my note  videos play and look great and you can do basically everything you can do on higher end phones my daughter primarily uses it for youtube downloading music playing game texting and calling it handles all this with no problem have not noticed any glitches or lag definitely if you need a phone for yourself or your child this phone is a great choice oh yeah i have downloaded so many apps and it still has a lot of room on internal memory i popped in a micro sd card just in case she runs out as well,positive
honest description and great customer service called me when i wanted more information found exactly what i was looking for in a phone,positive
this was a gift for my mom and she loves it no problems with cricket service we had it working in no timecomes with all listed i have an iphone and i was impressed,positive

this was purchased as a gift for my sons th birthday and for starting freshman year in high school it was factory sealed perfect condition we got him an otter case to protect from oopsies he has  he is very happy with the phone especially loves the bigger screen batterys long life the quality camera he has  he is in marching band and his phone is his lifeline to keeping up with his schedule and communications with band friends we had to have the att store fix the access point we use gophone to use the data plan but now all is working fine this phone will probably pass down to his brother or me down the road,positive
this phone is a powerhouse i owned the z z and now the xz and i gotta say this is the best ive seen since the super reliable z and the battery life is comparable if not better then the z and for those of you that do not know the battery on the z was outstanding the display on the xz is unbelievably clear it has  it is very well made love the design it has  it is ridiculously fast like the absolute fastest camera and shutter i have ever seen on a smartphone auto focus is unreal and camera app opens instantly huge improvement of past sonys highly recommend,positive
the phone is responsive quick to load an app looks great and performs great my only complaint too many buttons that can turn off the phone  ive accidentally turned off,positive
i love my new phone i get so many compliments and it looks and works great,positive
pros premium feel build quality quick charge close buttons nice display very snappy responces snapdragon  for gamers dual front facing speaker good camera front and back  bonus features and excellent securitycons the speakers are kinda weak but turning on dolby atmos will make up for it the cameras do not work to well at night and in low light places very slippery it comes with its own case but i would recommend a better case here on amazon and if your the person who has  who is on your phone all the time your battery will not last longoverall no doubt that this is one of the best phones of the year,positive
works great i would buy from this buyer again,positive

very good phone upgraded from iphone for my wife and she loves it got it on cyber monday at a very good price happy,positive
finally a phone that works without any hiccups or issues this phone simply works i have not had any weird issues at all with this phone and let me tell you that is rare normally ill find one nagging problem with a phone and it shall  it will drive me crazy until i finally cave in and decide to purchase a new phone so far in using my xperia z i have not run into any weird situations like that overall i love the form factor of the phone and the build quality is incredible this phone simply feels well built there is no creaking or play on the phone this thing was engineered flawlessly and sony has truly done a great job let us look at my overall take on the phonescreenrecently android phones have seen a big push for larger and larger screens but the z decided to buck that trend and not offer a bigger screen or crazy resolution instead sony stuck with a smaller screen size of  and a resolution of  x  although in a battle of specs this sounds bad i can say the screen looks really nice colors are well balanced and i have not had any issues in the sunlight with this phonewaterproof designthe waterproofing also has not let me down sony does not recommend submerging the phone but i can speak from experience this will probably not damage the phone i do not recommend doing this for two reasons though  with some bad luck water may actually damage the phone  you cannot really use this phone underwaterbattery lifeas a moderate user i need a phone that can last me throughout the day this is actually one of the reasons most phones just do not make the cut for me this phone actually manages to do a pretty respectable job of making it through the day screen on time caries between  hours and  hours but that is what im usually getting most days i have the phone set up to enable stamina mode which saves a lot of battery once the phone hits  this is different than the normal battery saving features that most phones have instead sony disables almost all background processes and only syncs when the screen is on and the phone is awake basically what this does is it allows the phone to enter a hibernation mode if you will until the next time you use the phone calls and texts will come in as will many things but emails or other programs which use data will not sync until a set interval or until the screen wakes up overall the phone will easily last a whole day from  am until about  pmcamerathis part is hit or miss it really depends what you are looking for and how picky you are with cameras as a hobby photographer i love to have a great camera taking a cell phone out and knowing it shall  it will take great photos is a must for me and sony really sold this phone as having one of the best cameras out there sadly this is rather misleading does the phone take good pics yes is it one of the best cameras no this camera struggles in the dark if you turn off flash and take a picture in a poorly lit room this camera kicks up the iso and you get a blurry noisy mess in daylight the camera works flawlessly the nice thing about the camera is that it is a wideangle lens so you shall  you will get much more of the image in the frame than you will with most other phones if you are looking for a true manual mode this just does not cut it sony has mindboggingly integrated a terrible ui and limited what you can do to  mp i just do not understand what they are trying to do set the camera to superior auto and it jumps back up to  mp and takes great pics the thing sony just does not get it i do not need them to hold my hand let me set the camera to manual and get creativecall quality and speakerscall quality is good and people have not had issues hearing me actually the only time this was a problem was after i had washed the phone water blocks the mic and people will not hear but then again this makes sense and should not be an issue because when was the last time you made a call underwater or being dumped water on speakers are not the loudest but they work well enough if you are looking for an extremely loud phone this is not it sometimes i have a hard time hearing waze over the radio but i tend to have the radio a bit too loud sometimes anywaysoverallthe camera would have to be the one biggest disappointment i think the battery life is good and the design and feel of the phone is great the minimal skin that sony puts on the z is also welcome and sony will be updating this device to the latest version of android but they do take a bit sony tends to update most of their phones but they do take a bit to make sure everything works with these ideas in mind i definitely like the phone in typical sony fashion they throw a bunch of features that you may or may not want but if you find a device that supports a feature this phone has ldac is a great example of this then it simply works no headaches no weird set up this is what i wanted in a phone and im pleased having purchased the xperia z,positive
this phone is more than i expected it has all the features of a ipod and a tablet i downloaded kindle and is able to purchase my text book and novels and get to read it right on my phone is this cool or what,positive

i really like this phone and i love the lg brand simple to use reliable good looking and of course inexpensive there are two things i did not get a user manual for this phone so i have to go online to figure out some features second i wish lg would put in a block caller feature on this phone i get a lot of spam phone calls and as a payasyougo customer it can get costly great phone but please put in block caller feature maybe there is one on the phone but i have not figured it out or i have to buy an app i do not know i have to check my user manual which i did not get,positive
really good,positive
amazing case very strong made by excellent materials rubber and plastic it fits  and easy access to all buttons and plugs except the micro sd and the sim it has  it is expensive but it protects totally your device one more thing the case comes with a build in screen protector that you do not need to fix it also there is a hard plastic cover to fold the case after using and you can use it as stand,positive
my husband and i both got these phones so far so good we are not  am not having any problems the issues that other people brought up are not  am not even happening with us we use them with straight talk and the easiest way we found to switch them over was with the bring your own phone activation kit took me less than  minutes with no issues i definitely recommend this phone,positive
love the way it fits my phone and it has  it is sturdy it has  it is definitely a girly pink but i like that because it has  it is easy to spot in my purse or wherever i set it down,positive
works great i develop apps for cell phones so i did not need to subscribe this unit to a carrier im completely satisfied my needs,positive
before i purchased i contacted the seller to make sure the version he sells is for us tmobile and will enable g lte the box i got was a tmobile box it even included a microsimcard i have had it for a week now and i am getting g lte speeds and everything seems to be working very well i am so happy about my purchase from an amazon seller because the price was  less regular price for tmobile customers just make sure you ask the seller directly which version it is  there are  versions of lumia  rm international rm us version for tmobile and att rm asia version with no g source wikipedia i got the rm and g lte works great on tmobile,positive

i received the phone rather quickly im quite impressed by the condition of the phone after being used i was not sure if i would enjoy the larger screen but now i would not go back i bought this phone to put on straight talk and thought i would have conflict finding a sim card but i actually did not the phone takes the regular sim that they send so no need to worry plus the service is great and the phone runs rather fast i would not trade it,positive
great phone for a great price i got it because my iphone  kept messing up and i needed a working phone all in all this phone works alot better than my old one and it got to me within a few days altogether i am pleased,positive

phone worked well out of the box att user just insert your old phones sim and go however for texting you have to go to the set up menu and input the att message center phone number otherwise your texts will stay in the outbox music is great with clear sound camera has a flash and works for night scenes but the resolution is not that great wifi is automatically scanned just like a laptop does have not downloaded all the nokia apps to check out all the functions this smartphone can do expanding memory is easy with a phone slot on the side to max out to  gb great amazon price quick shipment way more positive add ons than the overpriced iphone video webcam available via  cameras not locked on to a monthly  data plan like the iphone battery on par with my previous cell phones touch screen is as good as it gets you can also just add atts media data plan down the road if you need  websurfing think its about  all in all nokia  is a winner not as well known then again you are not going to stand out as one of the apple peeps out there,positive
as expected unlocked ready to go,positive

i wanted to wait a month before writing my review but i have no complaints regarding how the product works being that the phone was refurbished it did not come in its original package which was a tiny bit off putting it did not come with any instruction or user guide pamphlet i am new to the iphone world but youtube helped fill in there aside from those tiny consthe phone works perfectly and i have not detected any issues thus far it arrived on time and charged for use,positive

my second smart phone works well so far no negatives enough memory no need for external sd even though i inserted gb microsd card,positive
this little powerhouse rocks this is the first cell phone in  years my husband has not cussed out on a daily basis it has  it is light it has  it is fast it has more than enough memory in the phone to handle anything he wants to do and he is in love we are planning to replace all  of our familys phones with this verykool jet phoneupdate now several weeks after the first review i have my own jet sl and im every bit as in love with it as my husband is his it has  it is much lighter than my old phone and the slightly larger screen allows me to easily use the on screen keyboard without hitting two buttons at the same time so far i have not got a bad thing to say about this phone,positive
this is a really good smartwatch for its value of course but people buying should know this even if the original does not not work on your phone you can always download a generic one on the playstore one more thing if you want whatsapp to show you the entire message on the screen of you watch you have to download whatsapp plus on your smartphone and activate mod ,positive
my husband and i use the straighttalk bring your own phone program i bought this phone to replace my htc sensation that i had been using because that phone could not seem to connect to the network properly anyhow at first i did not care for the look and feel of the vivid compared to the sensation now after a few days of using i do not miss my other phone at allto me the only difference now is my device connects properly to the network we have att simsthe tech specs on this phone are nearly identical dual core processor beats screen resolution ect to the sensation so at a lower price you get all the wonderful performance of a htc phone what has  what is not to love,positive
iphone gs is a solid smartphone it is relatively light and compact it has a premium feel and it is just beautiful the battery lasts all day long on reasonably heavy used with screen brightness at  per cent call quality is solid and antenna reception is consistent,positive

this phone has impressed me i bought it for my father but i use it quite often too simply put for its price i got much more than i expectedwe have had this phone for about three months we have installed many apps on it and use pretty much every aspect of it wifi headphones speaker bluetooth tethering gps you name it not once the phone has freezed or restartedthe phone runs android kitkat almost stock but it does have some minor customizations the user interface is simple and unaltered the construction is not as seamless as expensive phones but it is solidly built and looks quite goodsomething to understand is that at this price range the camera quality will not be the best still it can be used to capture a precious moment with decent detail the same goes for the screen although screen is not high resolution it is clear and brightif you are looking for a good inexpensive phone this is a great option i would not hesitate to buy it againsome cons the button placement the power and volume button are on the same side and close together in addition they are very soft i end up pressing the wrong button all the time and turning off the screen when taking photos this phone does not have a compass using maps or navigation is bit harder as a consequence the phone has stock applications that can not be disabled in fact it comes out of the box with two browsers we should be able to disable these nonessential applications,positive
i was a bit skeptical at first but i was very impressed it really is factory unlocked and it works on any network very impressed with apple express,positive
works great with tmobile,positive
this otterbox  defender series case is great and i love the price my first one that i had purchased through the store was considerably more in price i like the pink color,positive
i got my galaxy s the last year after getting this one i notice that the battery life improves hugely also the camera is a lot better even if the galaxy s is the best the s worth the change,positive
my first smartphone was a samsung rugby smart it was not the best although the call quality was good the ringer was really weak and the battery live awful this phone solved those problems it has a good ringer i had to download the ics update but no problems with that the battery is really good i got three full days out of it the call quality is great the phone is sleek looking and the screen size is fine i would suggest this phone to anyone that does not need the latest and greatest the price was right also,positive
got here on time works great so far,positive
you get more for what you pay for this thing great screen lags only in processor intensive games google android is awesome,positive
so far so good one little hitch my original idea was to replace my samsung galaxy s with this phone and simply transfer the sim over unfortunately this phone only takes microsims no big deal  i simply went to the tmobile store and bought a new microsim for  and had my account transferred overi have not yet gotten used to the ui i miss the settings button on the s which i use constantly so i need to be a little patienti love the bigger screen and the zippy speedalso i was a little worried about the battery life since some reviews were harping on that but with the update the power savings seem to be working i will update this reveiw later once i really start to use the phone more,positive
i really really like this phone,positive
this was a gift but i so love the games on it that i think iuse it more than the person for whom it was intended,positive
great phone it works very well and reliable i had it over a month and no problems,positive
perfect it has  it is a camera you can use to talk to people,positive
i come from the iphone i love the iphone or should i say i loved the iphonemy iphone  broke on me a while back and like a guy that wants to know if the neighbors wife better than his own i decided that i wanted to try an android phonesince i come from an top tier phone i went and bought the top tier htc one that was a greatish experience and i kind of enjoyed it but then i lost it somewhere probably in a cabsince my first android experience with the htc was somewhat good and i was sick of breaking or loosing  phones i decided i would buy a middle of the road not to pricey ok phonethen the moto x came in the mail holy crap snappy as hell every thing i used to run on my high end phones runs just as smooth on this one but that is not what makes this phone stand outstock android  a few tweaks like the active display and touchless control sets this phone apart more than that it sets new standards something that very very few phone have done in yearsi could not go back to a phone that would have me press a button to display the time sound trivial maybe it is but im lazy and you are to you just do not know it yettouchless control is great i love seeing the jealous eyes of iphone owners when i say ok google now without touching it and the screen pops upother android phone makers should take notes here why invest money in designing a stupid custom baked layer of creamy os crap on top of the already excellent android looking at you htc and samsung  vanilla android is oh so much better lighter cleaner sleeker snappier and simpleryou should not care about this phone specsget this phoneit is the proof that  phones are overpriced and overrated,positive
i love my phonei can get all the bells and whistles without spending  on a phone everything that an android has this phone has you also can take really good selfies cause the camera has a front and back flash the only down side is that it takes a while to charge the phone but im cool with that cause i save  yaaassssss,positive
i purchased this phone from amazon aware that a lot of variability exists regarding the opinions of other purchasers however i have owned a razr v phone for several years with no problems i am very gratified that the phone i received was everything i desired the phone worked flawlessly while i was in europe i also used the modal sim card that amazon provided free with the phone and the reception was superb with regard to my calls as well to my incoming callsi was particularly impressed with the high quality of the aluminum casing of this phone much better than my domestic razr v which has a plastic casing i dropped it a couple of times with no damage or problems it is a sturdy cell phone while it is designed as a european cell phone it can be set for either a  hour clock or the englishus  hour ampm time format the supplied battery also worked well and i often went several days before recharging it my phone came with an english manual and an us charging unit all in all an excellent international phone i just purchased another one to replace my plastic domestic razr v phone,positive

phone seems to be typical lg robust designmaterials this is not a us model the labeling on the lg box indicated it was originally destined for the africa market default time zone was set to abuja and frenchportugueseenglish owners manual only lists customer service number in lagos as you might expect the charger has the round plugs typical in europe and africa i guess but they did include an adapter to get you to the standard us plug phone accepted an att gophone sim card with no problem im sure local sim cards from europe or asia will work equally wellthis is a great way to get a local number while travelling abroad and avoid high roaming charges that us carriers charge there,positive
this product is of high quality  recommended,positive

with this phone at first didnt have so much expectations about it after catching up with the device is a whole different story the phone is great stylish run smoothly eventhough it took me a while to take the best of the camera pics came out beautifully bottom line phone is simply great,positive
this is a great alternative to unlocked phone if you are smart enough to follow instructions and change your apn phone was as good as new out of the box and should work with all gsm sim cards it also has a global gsm option which should be good enough for it to be used outside us just follow the instructions  send by the seller and you should be up  running i would definitely recommend buying it from buyspry i am glad i did and they were very helpful i am using a ho wireless sim card and they were precise in letting me know exactly what to do great alternative if you are not  am not willing to spend huge and yet get a high end flagship phone,positive
wonderful phone cool feature,positive

i have had the air  for a few days now and i could not be happier i did my research because unnecto is not a very wellknown brand and i was worried because i did not know what to expect first the device is very thin and comes in a nice premium white box it includes a user manual charger usb data cable battery and headphones i also checked their website and they have a  year warranty on all their productsnow about the use it has a bright hd screen that is great for browsing the internet emails or using it for facebook or other social media speaking of social media the  megapixel camera takes some amazing shots for my instagram or snapchat one of my favorite features is the smile shot where as soon as you smile the phone takes a picture the front  megapixel camera is also great for when i skype with my family or take selfies the responsiveness of the screen felt a little sluggish at first but when i removed the protective screen film that came with it the screen became much more responsivei particularly enjoy the pure android version that makes the phone seem so simple to use i use my air  every day as my main phone and it has been smooth and reliable i use att and the data speeds are also pretty good my phone always has the g h on all the time the phone has gb of internal memory but i take a lot of pictures and that is why i bought a gb microsd card just in case i also bought an unnecto air  silicone case which fits like a glove and will keep my phone safe from breaking overall this device is a perfect combination of price and quality,positive
worked right out of the box not a single scratch or dent as i it was purchased from the apple store itself,positive
this is a very good basic cellphone and works perfectly in venezuela,positive
excellent product purchased movistar venezuela,positive
this is my second otterbox defender my first being for my first s my first otterbox defender saved my phone several times this case seems like ultimate protection against most everyday accidents without impeding the phones capabilities sometimes using the fingerprint scanner on the s seems difficult could be because of the case but i cannot say with certainty because i have not tried it without the case,positive

this particular kind of stainless steel is slick and sleek looking i was happy with the regular stainless steel one i got but once i saw this i gave the other one to my sister and have been rocking this one ever since thankfully there are so many accessories since when i wear the gold milanese loop band i was not big on the black and gold so i bought a simple easily snapped on plastic gold cover and you could not tell it was the black stainless steel from just talking to someone unless they want to look at it then i explain how much fun im having with the accessoriesif i could afford to buy these for those closest to me i would but since i cannot ill say for myself and my sister that we love it,positive
i got this phone day before yesterday arrived on time the phone was sealed and is brand new loved it i bought it for my mother in india so i will have to take it to india and check if it works with the service providers there it should hopefully ,positive
good phone reliable does the job,positive
the moto e is a great phone for an inexpensive price i bought this phone for a friend who was destroying the cheap free phones that his carrier gave him as well as an iphone  he owns several thousand head of cattle and spends all day jumping up and down from a pickup into a cattle pen he drops his phones on concrete and into cattle pens he does not need a lot of fancy features on the phone just durability and the ability to run a few apps i suggested the moto e because of the gorilla glass after  months he was happy calling it the best phone he has  he is had since the original razr he liked it enough to buy  more for his hired handsyou cannot compare this with the moto x as it has  it is a lower spec phone but the combination of features and durability works for a broad group of people who just want a good usable phone that will not break on the first drop,positive
when my phone broke and i was not eligible for an upgrade i thought i was out of luck then i searched on amazon and found this little thing and i am so happy buying it refurbished it a lot better than used because it has  it is basically a brand new phone it looks and works perfect it does not come with a sim card but i just went to a sprint store and asked for one and they gave it to me for free im so happy with my purchase of this phone and i would definitely recommend buying from this company if you need a new phone but do not have an upgrade very fast shipping too,positive
worked great  was easy to get on a prepaid card and switched carriers with no fuss cool watch ,positive
pretty darn good give it a week to get used to  it has  it is no premier flagship phone but it streams well is tiny and lasts a day with pretty moderate to heavy browsing and usage syncs easy with blutooth g works good on cricket,positive
it worked fine everything that was said plus a little more was on there and worked out great for me it was totally worth the price,positive
i absolutely love this phone i do not understand the negativity that some reviews mention it is a sleek looking gorgeous phone especially the chrome version i got the most amazing thing is the display you shall  you will clearly see a difference with its k display it takes great pictures crisp and detailed im not a heavy user and the battery lasts me at least  days easily music on this phone is sonys high standard coming to the software it is near stock android and runs smoothly i was worried about getting this phone reading some reviews but im glad i went ahead with it there is heating issue but only when you use the camera for a longer period but it cools down quick too works perfectly in sync with the sony smartwatch  i use a clear case to show off the chrome awesomeness this is a great smartphone and hopefully sony comes up with the successor in the next weeks ifa,positive
im not the kind who needs the newest if you feel this way this is not the phone for you even if it has  hardware the phone is pretty fast does everything you need it to do and does it in styleseriously windows phone does have less apps but its not missing the essentials maybe a couple of them but for the most part it has everything out therethe camera its pretty average though even by  standards but i dont mind that much since camera quality its not a priority for me,positive
my original tmobile phone was supposed to be everything that this phone was only it was not for the same price i got an android  gingerbread with an amoled touch screen though it was pretty to look at the phone could not update and it caused me major grief when the sd card slot died and the phone slowed down after only a couple months of owning it instead of buying out of contract and adding more pain to my wallet i looked to amazon i had heard that sony was starting to make amazing smartphones and found that an android  ics was available  i read many reviews against this and other xperia types there are more expensive ones out there that only run   i wondered how and why this was as this phone is a good deal  less than those after thinking really hard i bought it  two days later i was able to play with it though the screen is not an amoled and does not look the greatest  i got used to it in a matter of hours this phone is seriously fast when you want an app open it does not fumble the screen around flickering trying to operate  it just opens quickly and smoothly it has built in walkman technology only the best of what you would imagine from sony with level adjustments and equalizers built in with no added app or cost to get it unlike my old phone where i had to buy a  app to get the same basic functionality the downside is sonys timescape which has not had an update in months so getting the live social media updates right from the homescreen gives an error from the looks of it even the new sony xperia series still have this problem and sony may never fix it but i took it off the homescreen and that took care of that it has a changing color theme light which is very cool and changes from blue for facebook or text message updates or red if you get google updates and it looks extremely sleek and futuristic which is everything i have wanted in a phone it has  it is the greatest purchase i have have ever made for myself on such a small devicethe camera is a true mp camera and takes very clean photos and it takes them quickly the video is a bit different  the quality is brought down quite a bit the microphone on this is the clearest ive heard on a mid level phone as well as the speaker on the back  sony knows sound and they do it really wellthe phone is very lightweight to the point that i thought that there was nothing inside of it at firstafter using it for a couple weeks it has  it is showing me there is something in there and it has  it is doing a fantastic jobsony used to leave a very bitter taste in my mouth  from tvs catching on fire to sparking vaio batteries i used to be an apple only kind of person but my family introduced me to android and google  which i thought was best with samsung i no longer feel that way i feel sony has started to become an electronics giant again and i am excited to see what they will bring in the future,positive

so far amazing i have an iphone s and this has paired smoothly without any downloads or qr code i bought the silver plus which has updated software my calls are very clear i can call out and receive calls i can use the calendar alarms vibrate or chimes i can also set the ringer to vibrate or ringtone or both i can take pictures record video and voice recordings and the sound quality is great i also added a g mini sd chip for storage and the watch has a handy file manager that shows the album covers to all of music once i select the song the fm radio is terrific the watch comes with a set of headphones that work with the watch and the software interface is as nice as the brand name that this watch looks identical to sams neo  wink this smartwatch provides an excellent hands free way to receive calls it has a quality build and the band is a very soft and flexible siliconlike rubber my only complaint at all with this watch is that it easily synced all the contacts from my iphone yet it did not transfer the numbers only the names still troubleshooting that for the price the look and the fast phone functions on your wrist this is a great buy and i am hoping it will have a decent lifespan will update if anything odd or unfortunate happens i am very surprised and pleased for now ,positive

camera video not the greatest but everything else is excellent,positive
 months user reviewas i have never heard of the blu brand i was quite hesitant to make the order however after  months of usage the blu vivo  is holding up well and prove that it is an excellent cell phone for my everyday needs if you want an affordable product that looks good is not costing your rent and still gives solid performance this is the phonedesign  the design is simple yet pleasure to look at if you are very picky then i would say the material kinda feel cheap at the back it is nothing spectacular compare to the newest iphone or samsung however if i told my nongeek friends that i purchase this for  they would probably believe the phone is quite light personally i have no trouble holding it for a long timebattery  as a geek i read and surf the internet a lot from news reddit to ebook i generally spend  hours everyday reading or emailing from the phone after work i put about  hours of music during my work out the blu vivo would normally last the whole day and have around    left before i go to bed as far as my  months go by the battery has not yet to show sign of deteriorateperformance  the blu vivo does not have much power for heavy gaming or newest tech like finger printing eye recognition so if you are into that then i would suggest to look for some where else everything from reading watching youtube to surfing using normal app is smooth and i only have very few moments when the phone gets small lagdurability  i am too lazy to put on the screen protector however since this phone has a gorilla  glass it is resistant to scratch seven months in with a couple drops the phone has no scratch and is good as new i do use the cheap plastic case they provide thoughcamera  if there is a catch then it would be the horrible camera the phone has the pictures i took from the blu vivo  would be bland and sometimes my face would look like a potato due to the low resolutionvalue  if you are into a lot of gaming or photography then stay away for a casual user like me who just need a phone for reading call message and other simple stuffs this phone is perfect for its price it has large screen looks good feels like a highend product and has a decent battery,positive

after a few months of use i could say this phone was the best phone i ever had i was sick of apple and samsung i am so satisfied with this phonethe only problem with this phone is the poor battery life  otherwise if you consider the pricing this is the best phone  large screen  impressive performance and selfie king compared the screen quality with a galaxy note  and because the note  comes with higher resolution it shows better picture but screen quality is same as iphone x i am using tmobile and network works prefect g  everything prefectspeaker quality is good make sure to update the phone to latest version sonys latest update will resolve many problems and do reset factory after update make the phone to boot up clean on new firmware and then install your programsit has not much bloatware like provider locked cellphones but consider buying extra memory it does not cost you much  because there is not much space left on the cellphone storage   gb unfortunately as today i could not find a good screen protector for it all you can buy are junk i attached a photo about the camera performance and cellphone package itself ,positive
i have tmobile phone works perfect would recommend it i got the gold the phone feels looks and performs good,positive

i had some apprehensions being a no warranty product but at its arrival they were all dissipated the cell phone came in its box completely new and unlocked with a cable for charging its battery at home and headphones its performance and screen resolution is outstanding my only disappointment was its manual which was more the sketch of a manual than a real manual with too few topics covered but being used to cell phones that was not a problem in my personal case i did a portability with it from a previous company and everything went just fine,positive
good service i happy,positive

 beautiful design looks absolutely premium camera a huge upgrade from xperia z i feel that it produces better photos than my lx does removal of the lousy flip covers on z makes the waterproof function more practical i took it with me to santa monica beach and take pictures in the sea  no problemwhat i do not like  sometimes it can take almost  seconds to launch the camera battery life is not as good as z my z compact has  power left after  pm and z has only around  to  so it has  it is burning almost twice of the battery overheating at the upper part of the phone above the nfc logo but it has  it is acceptable as most of the time you will not be touching that area,positive

although doubtful at first that a samsung s would be this cheap i got this for my sister at her request since she did not trust the cheaper options on ebay after checking it out i can guarantee it is not a fake the performance and build of the phone is solid with a beautiful screen but then again its a samsung with a hefty price tag i personally own and love my one plus one which is so much cheaper yet just as snappy although the samsung has a better screen somewhat better looking and better camera considering that you can get two for the price of one samsung it is worth it im not gonna bother listing stats because you can google those anyways enough about my phone now i got this with one day shipping and it came quickly and yea thats about it heads up about the platinum gold though the glare when under light is pretty bright and it does not look as gold as we would like it also the back is glass so please put a case on it or else it will be filled with light scratches and fingerprints by the end of the day you get it the fingerprint sensor is a bit iffy at times and theres a bug where the touchscreen will stop working sometimes but a reboot and a software update will fix that,positive
loved the phone feels good in hand compared to nexus   you can see and feel quality loved the notifications and the voice control is the best ive seen photos has bluish tint but it does not matter for me,positive

excellent guy he has a good customer service i bought from him an iphone s with a good price it works very good i likes it,positive
ive been really aggrevated with a variety of recent phones because i could not hear or be heard clearly on them this phone has excellent voice clarity and seems to find a strong signal where ever i go the interface took a little getting used to but now i navigate around on it without problem im  and i like how i can use it without needing my reading glasses the camera takes decent not great shots but is very easy to use i did need to call att and have data blocked on the phone because i do not subscribe to a data service plan and att loves when you use it anyway to charge a small fortune per kb the phone works great on wifi and synchs easily to my outlook  calender and task list the gps takes awhile to find satellites but then works very well with spoken turnbyturn directions that equal my garmin the keyboard is small but my thumbnails always seem to end up hitting the right key overall im very pleased i wish i had taken this path much sooner than i did,positive
great fit great protectiona bit too bulky to fit comfortably in a back pocketbut i would definetly recommend this case,positive

i bought it during the black friday sales and it has  it is worth it especially with  off the device is reliable and it runs on pure android the camera is nice and fast the screen is welllit and the color are very bright i already installed my apps and all of them are working well im really satisfied with its great amount of memory and that will not be my concern anymore maybe you have read some reviews about it showing its pros and cons but it has  it is a great smartphone in short in case you do not want to spend much money on a cellphone this is your phone,positive
so i was very skeptical on if i should get this because some reviews were not the best and you never know with buying online but i got it in apple packaging with all the cords so organized and i was pleasantly surprised that the phone was perfect condition perfect everything so im very pleased and i do recommend because its well worth it,positive
the phone was in excellent shape it did not appear to even be used i was surprised that it had ever been carried could not be more satisfied,positive

great deal nice rugged phone saved  from buying at sprint store,positive
it has  it is not the flashiest phone on the market but it works well has a great screen fast fingerprint sensor and performs fast enough for what i need im using it only as a work phone mainly to check emails and do google hangouts with infrequent use this phone lasts days between charges very happy with the battery life,positive
truly unlocked and so far have tried a sim from att and one other generic in ny usa also worked in the philippines and i will test this winter in thailand no issues starting up inserting new sim was easy and had incredibly awesome reception ironically better than in the states i traveled with an old unlocked tmobile gsm phone for over  years but now with smartphones and sim cards having included data plans i made the jump to a smart phone for traveling im truly satisfied with this purchase and highly recommended this model phone minor differences with the standard samsung iii but i do not mind tap phones to transmit data is not on this model etc the price is unbeatable as i attempted to purchase this one week prior on a trip to france and it was literally double the amount battery life excellent and size is a lot more comfortable to holdcarry than my standard s i personally prefer the size of the mini over the new trend of brick size phones one note this is a gsm phone which will not work on cdma systems so you will not be able to use this with verizon sprint metro pcs and some others only gsm hopefully this review helps,positive
product of very good quality,positive
very good phone,positive

im in love with this phone it has  it is just so pretty interface is beautiful and easy to use it is also on the smaller side for androids so it fits more easily in my hand i was a little nervous about it being compatible with tmobile but i have not had any issues so far just to be clear you need to buy a sim card if you do not already have one there is no sim card with this and you need a nano sized sim card i think this is a steal for the price enjoy,positive
i return to what i know and im comfortable with thank you for a quality product,positive
this phone is very slim  cute and easy to use it is a flip phone and can be opened easily with one hand setting up this phone was a piece of cake it came with an adaptor plug which can fit any ac plug the only negative is that it did not come with a driver cd and a data cable a big plus was that it was unlock and was able to accept any sim card great phone milton,positive
this product is trash,positive
yes it did meet my expectations,positive
excelent device works as every review says it wouldthe only thing i complain about is that the dc charger and car hanger did not come in the package and never arrived the web site sais this two items are part of the package,positive
i received this phone yesterday about a week after ordering wthe free shipping option and went through the activation on netwireless website for byop when i bought the phone i also ordered an universal gglte net sim card which you can also buy in the store for more money i already was on net mo unlimited service with a net bought phone and was basically transferring my number and service to this unlocked phone i followed the sim instructions put in the sim and went to the website for current customers to complete the transfer which was easy the website told me the transfer was in progress and should be completed in a few hours but could be up to  business days and my old phone would work until the transfer was completed it was about an hour later my old phone did not work and the new phone was active tracfone net parent texted me the install for apn settings which i did with no problem i saw g speed mobile and easily connected to my home wifi after the wifi was connected i checked for software updates and the phone updated to  no problem i was really nervous to do the byop with an unlocked phone but can honestly say at this point i am extremely pleased with everything the phone itself is awesome especially for the price  and the phone appeared brand new in its box even better the simtransfer was all done on the internet no customer service needed i would definitely recommend,positive
this phone is tough it can take an abuse,positive

awesome phoneafter going through a long list of reviews i have purchased this phone to give it a test also i do lot of testing on apps and other os related performance tuning and now it is close to  month now and this phone is really really good technically speaking this phone is much better than iphones and has all the features that samsung currently providing for their models that are in market now for example tap  share you can share photos with a windows phone of similar model or you can share it with any android phonewhen i initially got this phone it was with windows version xxxx after two weeks this phone showed that there was an update available which was with version something like that and after that upgrade which took just  mins on wifi it immediately showed that there was an update for  upgrade took a little longer but it did upgrade to windows  without any force that really changed a lot changes are exponential  definitely is a good version improved battery life and better apps and performance is really goodapps currently i have installed close to  daily used apps and still i have close to gb of space on the phone i tested with other very high end graphic games that worked out really well too but yeah drains battery faster if you use it for such a kind of stuffspace this comes with gb which in most scenarios is sufficient and even if you want to you can still add a microsd card and expand it upto gb i did not try this part but yes based on os on the phone it can take to that extentbattery life when it was in  it used to come for close to   day i use it for personaloffice purpose with lots of email and read lot of books through kindle apps and browse on articles on online after  upgrade it comes close to  days with all the things i usually do and by end of nd day i still had  of battery life well this is my personal test but this definitely varies with the way others use this phonei gave it a try with other iphoners and androiders they felt comfortable using this phone it is light weight and very comfortable looks professionally goodfor the price i paid on this phone it is really an awesome phone feel free to ask any questionoh yeah it is an unlocked phone though it has that att logo and all other att related apps i am using it with tmobile and i am sure it works for others too ,positive

i had an e and ei before so e was a natural choice this phone now serves as my mp player and gps i have a gig memory card which is  full now with songs and garmin maps phone works much faster compared to both e and ei battery life is not as good as my ei but again i m using this phone a lot compared to the previous one i connect it to my car stereo to play music now great sound qualitycamera quality is not as good as ei  colors balance is really weird nokia should try to fix that with a firmware upgrade i dont like pressing the t button to autofocus either its a real painsound quality is awesome its a nokia so lets not talk more about the sound qualityno dual antenna like ei tends to lose bars when held from the bottom so either change the way u hold the phone or dont waste ur money buying this phoneits the slimmest smart phone out there and feels pretty solidly built keyboard is smaller compared to ei but u get used to it sooni am using it on tmobile so no g for me i dont really care about g speed anyways as long as i can do some light browsing and check my email i can use the front camera with camerafx application dont really like why nokia chose not to let us use the front camera to take pictures as they do in nseries phonesin total great phone with some shortcomings hopefully nokia would fix them in the upcoming firmware upgrades,positive

the lg arrived very fast it was sealedi am new to android but can defiantly say it is a good productthe camera is very impressive especially the videoi had iphone before the iphone fluent user interface is very addictive however there is no real comparison between the two products the lg is like a ballistic missal and has the capabilities to do much more than the iphonei love the lg swift keyboard it is amazingbattery life on the lg is a bit disappointing but i heard that after longer use it is getting better,positive

i believe unequivocally that it is the best cell phone ive had so far nokia also did well to use windows phone that is a really efficient system that does not go by slow as one would install more apps simply amazingmy recommendation is to not buy a cell phone just for technical characteristics with high expectations often as in this case this phone is good for the hardware and also to have a good operating system like windows phone  iphone no more no more android,positive
this phone is more than my thinking i love it it should be worth to buy this mobile unlocked phone,positive

just got mine yesterday in the mail as expected unlocking was easy unlock code was stickered on the back of phone getting lte speeds with no problem you want to save yourself a bunch of problems when ordering this phone the rm by att is what you want to buy here in the us not the international version the   rm version does support lte just plain happy with mine the seller also included a car charger not listed in the description although it was new i never got the original box charger data cable or paperwork the lumia site has a pdf document to download from their site on how to use windows phones are pretty straight forward but is nice to have a manual but no big deal another thing was the cheep knock off samsung  amp house charger and charge data cable clearly these are not made by nokia and the cord already had broken apart on the usb end but no big deal since i have my old lumia  charger and data cable already if that do not bother you then buy it love the size came with no scratches or cosmetic flaws big size lte unlocked phone all is great might want to get a case for it fyi it is a big phone and dropping it would end your pleasure of it i got a soft rubber case for use and a portfolio one with card case to carry around in my pocket the portfolio one has where you can shut it up over the screen for better everyday protection and i recommend one of such over all i am happy with my new  windows phone it is the best phone i have owned to date another thing it ships with lumia black update it to lumia cyan then lumia denim which is the new latest windows  takes time to update but worth the wait windows is supposed to roll out windows phone  soon and yes the  is eligible for this update hope this helps people,positive
i was suspicous at first but decided to take my chance the phone arrived in brand new condition and with all the accessories everything was sealed with plastic protector considering the price this is a amazing deal you can probably get one from ebay for about  but that usually does not include accessories and the phone itself is in new other condition whatever that meansactivation took about  minutes in the tmobile storethe phone does not come with a tmobile logo though i am not sure if it actually was made for some other carriers or even overseas but so far so good i will update this in a month if anybody is interestedok it has  it is been almost a month everything still good my daughter loves the games on it and my wife is satisfied with the battery life just for curiosity i checked the esn at apple website and gladly found it is under warranty until next july i guess i just got good luck,positive
upgrading my iphone from s to plus and now s plus from t mobile apple has never disappointed mefrom silver to golden and now rose goldmy iphones are getting new colors day by dayeverybody loves colors and apple has portrayed our color fascination in their new iphone s pluslook wise  plus and s plus are mostly same but most added feature which makes it different are its d touch with bright vibrant display  but not as bright as galaxy s edge plus and of course addition of new color rose gold the best parts of iphone s plus which is my favorite also are lightning speed  mp camera siris sweet voice  inch bigger resolution screen and pressuresensitive d touch display is a win win over  plusbattery life is slightly better in s plus optical image stabilization for photos and video can surely make a difference deliver more blurfree photos in certain light conditions design wise it looks identical to the iphone  plus only difference is in size of  inch compared to  inchand the small s logo on the rear below the word iphone  it has  it is slightly thicker than  plus fingerprint resistant glass makes the screen smudge freenow not so attractive aspects cost is higher than others flat rear and rounded metal edges makes it a bit fussy while grippingin a nutshell i love this new avatar of iphone created by apple ,positive
really good,positive
i buy this watchs for my nephew he is out country but the work perfect he is very happy with the watch,positive
i just received my blu life  this past saturday january   and so far i am extremely satisfied i was previously using an iphone  but the screen was burning out and i did not want to dish out the dollars for an unlocked iphone  or  i have used android phones before my iphone so transferring my apps to his phone from my previous dormant google play account was amazingly simple and fast i wanted a good android phone because i actually missed the android os not that there is anything wrong with the iphone os it just doesnt come across to me as smooth and user friendly as the android systemmy blu life  was at my house within a week of placing the order this phone was shipped with android kit kat just in time for lollipop to be released that was plenty quick enough for me so far so good with my blu life  it instantly locks on to my home wifi the minute i am in range which means as i am pulling into my driveway the couple of videos i have watch worked smoothly no texting issue no problem getting g signal i use straight talk as my provider inserting my micro sim card and sd card was effortlessi am very please with a couple of small things that actually mean a lot since i have not witness this with other cell phone makers the phone came with a screen saver installed you will notice it after you pull of the screen information also on top of the phone and they also provide a fairly transparent rubber case to put on the phone to protect the back like i said small things that make a difference the usual accessories also come with the phone ear buds usb cord and charger adapter and a spare screen protector for when the first needs replacing you know they always wear outi have been away from work since getting this phone so i cannot say how battery life is on it for certain but once i am back to my regular routine i will find that out since i use text and email apps a lot along with that annoying fb take way too many phone calls play music on my phone while at work and at the gym i do not use any gaming apps or watch many videos so my battery life may not represent what others will get if they do such thingsonly con to this point is that i have to press the onoff button to take the phone out of sleep mode i could have sworn on my previous android phone i was able to touch the screen or the home button for that i will update about battery life and any issues i have in about a week after putting it into heavy use on a regular basis,positive

when i first received this phone i was under the impression that it was an international model and could not be used in the usa while starting to write a negative review a screen showed up saying contact amazon first which i did and was led to believe that the only option i had was to return it for a refund and was totally disappointed after i posted the negative review we were contacted by the mercate group who assured us it was usable in the usa the next day i was able to get it up and going easier than i expected and love the phone i apologize for my initial negative impression and glad the company contacted me thank you,positive

great quality for a reasonable price dual sim slots make the life one x capable of having two cellular lines operable on one device if you need to maintain one line for work and another personal use that has  that is a viable option on these unlocked sim slots i tested the phone with an att sim and was working perfect the lack of lte which is not great but noticeably better than hspa here left me wishing the phone could do more the life one x does not have lte radios so users must rely on hspa  mbps bands  so it also works with tmobile in many us markets also it work perfect in mexico with telcel g g hspa and hspa i ready did the test with this company,positive

ok so i got this and it was nice but i could not use it because i wanted straight talk and it was gmi or cdma or gsm one of the two and was not compatible with my cell towers i live in a rural area with limited internet and cell phone service i would buy from a local store especially your local walmart if you want straight talk like me,positive
this was my first otter box and i absolutely love it i always steered away from the otter boxes because they were so bulky and the screen protectors affect the touchscreen experience this one is great because there is no screen protector and it is very slim it seems to protect my phone well too,positive

have been using this phone now for about a month im using a att sim card threw straight talk i have alsoused this phone with a att sim card threw net so ihave tried the dual sim card method works just as statedone phone  different numbers was easy to set up after iread the instructions  made sure the software wasupdated  the apn settings were changed per theinstructions i love the live photo function which i haventseen on any of the other smartphones  the fm radioplays great but you must have the ear plugs in becausethey have a built in antenna but u can play threw thespeakers on the phone its hd  screen is just as big as theiphone   the samsung  and works just as good withoutthe high price will definitely order another blu recommend to others make sure to order a phone casethrew amazon when u order the phone walmart is nowoffering some of the blu phones in the store havent seen this one  hd or any accessories for the blu phones,positive
have used this moto e for about a month in korea and found out moto e is much better than expectedim using mostly basic functions of a phone such as reading short stories news articles and listening to internet radio under wifi this is definitely a wonderproduct for its extreme low priceday  moto e looked a littler too much simpler than sony or samsungs products out in the market but is quite fast and smooth if you have used googles pad before it would be easier to get used to this phone i mean the flow of buttons and icons you need to press various free apps were available in android app store to customize the phone for my stylesurprising performance perhaps comes from its software and hardware optimized and also from not covering the basic android features with manufacturers own user interface softwaresmessages either short or long ones did not cause any problem when this phone connected to the operator network in korea i was also satisfied with amazons quick delivery at the time of purchaseoverall i am more than pleased with this product and ample information given by amazon system before my buying decision,positive
super nice phone especially great camera and display for the price the ps remote play is cool too,positive
great phone still learning to use all the features works well with the consumer cellular phone plan,positive
i was an android guy for years honestly until ios  and iphone  i think android was comparable now it is really no contest the polish of an iphone is just unbeatable if you really really need your smart phone to work under complex use cases ie when driving blue tooth navigating etc your life may depend on it just get the best and be done with it,positive
good product ,positive
i just upgraded from a razr phone and this new krazr is exceptionally nice the phone has great reception the sound quality  volumn are very good the menus are very easy to get aroundit fits your face well not too short as many phones now are and operating the phone is simple this phone is clearly evident of motorolas evolution in the cellphone industry by the way you can customize the softkeys to be whatever you want them to be likewise you can customize the menus to appear as you would like they have really thought of the user and have made this phone very user friendly as well it seems that the majority of the people i talk to are not  am not as interested in whistles  bells as much as they just want a plain old good phone this is it however if you want more you can load your mp music on to it you can use the calendar you can take a picture and if you are really adventurous you can access the internet and also retreive your email by the way this phone is capable of taking advantage of the cingularatt edge network which gives you faster than usual internet i highly recommend this good looking well working phone,positive
was a present and person who has  who is received is very happy i do recommend it for people who do not demand high technology,positive
great phone,positive
my sister loves the phone looked like just the picture and works fine,positive
phone needs to be hard reset every now and again,positive
i got the luna one and it works perfectly highly recommend,positive
i sold sell to people brought us help raise money for trailer and with truck soon we not have job,positive
easy to use cheap and it works is pretty big on my arm but if it lasts for a year i figure there will be smaller ones out by then fun to get calls on in public everyone wants to see it,positive
great size and price it acts as a tablet and phone,positive
everything is fine cannot complain,positive
good site and product too bad i lost it in about a month  had to find another,positive
for some reason i thought the box was the size of a tablet but small and compact good idea so far so good will post updated review,positive
i love the updates and it seems faster than my old m,positive
great phone if you just want a phone,positive
yes it is very small but that is why i love it i am not using it with data i just wanted a smartphone interface and touchscreen the battery is thus very very long lasting i am sure it would not be as good if i were to use data regularly there is no lag or performance issue that i have come across yet,positive
great team at a great price including cheap phones is one of the best pretty hot but because i gave it a really exaggerated use but nothing that does not give any other,positive
love it even though it was not as dark as the one i ordered was suppose to be,positive
the seller was fantastic the phones even better windows phone ftw,positive
it has  it is all in the details everything about the device is striking it is the embodiment of sony and grants you access to all of the google and sony entertainment network services,positive
so after using this phone for a while now ive come to a conclusion that this is a great phone for the price i paid there was just a new system upgrade so the phone works faster and the video quality is awesome and also do not buy a phone case because it comes with one already in the box,positive
smartphone is amazing others say that this is because most has even described some very good detail of this team  but i can only bow before this marvel created by huawei that once again shows us how you can do great things with good components and make them affordable for most  once again congratulations,positive
i bought it for my father and is fascinated her sister saw it and loved it it has  it is simple but efficient and not so small the screen is wide and its benefits are very good,positive

my son loves this phone its fast and easy to use,positive
completely satisfied,positive
soooo much better than the g version,positive
this lg g is fast and the screen is beautifuli will reconfirm that the g will not work in the us on cricket wireless att network but the g connection is plenty fast enough for my needs and i wanted a p screen for under  that was also unlockedhaving both a user replaceable battery and expandable storage is excellent for users who would like to keep there phone for longer than a yearbattery life is good easily lasting throughout the day with average usesoftware updates could be more frequent this phone is still on android  rumor has it that  will be released to the g but we will have to wait and seethe lg software overlay is very functional and does not detract from the experience whatsoeverthe camera takes excellent photos and is extremely fast to focus the camera is beyond what most will ever need in a smartphoneyou can even use this phone as a remote control but this feature is not the greatest due to the poor rangei think this is still the only phone available with a p screen in this price range and the extra gb of ram on the international version is appreciated i recommend buying a glass screen cover to protect the beautiful screen,positive
watch came on time works very good i have a att sim card in it my internet does not work tho headphones that come with it suck so i jus use a bluetooth speaker on it is loud so u can hear good when not using a headset,positive
just as described no problems with activation of the phone,positive

updated review  i have now had this phone over four months the original screen cover is still perfect and i have the spare still on hand that comes with the phone you also get a great rubber case and i have dropped the phone onto carpet several times or off our bed which is  off the ground i love this phone and would recommend it to anyone the battery life is still excellent and the battery is removeable so you can replace it if you have security concerns you can remove the battery and drain the remaining power by holding the buttons for about  seconds the phone gets better battery life if you remove active apps by holding down the primary button for about  seconds and you just swipe them away so they are stopped  i do this after every use for the apps i am not going to need the rest of the day i reboot once or twice a week this has been the best phone for my needs in the past four years during which time i had sony htc one samsung  apple  and two versions of the nokia windows phones this is simply a wonderful phone at a price that cannot be beat i stand by my earlier impressionsamazon offers free replacement and free shipping for returns if you do not like it  read their policy free replacement before returning is perfect as long you do not run more than  apps all the time it has good battery life  about  hours if you shut down wifi and bluetooth when not needed you get  hours with your screen brightness set to auto i love this phone  and it does everything for me i expect having had previously sony htc one samsung g nokia windows phonesi recommend this phone the replacement process at amazon is flawless  return a phone within days and never a problem and you do not pay shipping if phone defective i have switched out several poor performing phones take a chance you will not be disappointed,positive
my phone is in great shape and works perfectly i am completely satisfied,positive
received in top notch condition charger included,positive

i was skeptical about buying a used phone online the last company sent me an iphone  instead of a s so i checked out this company and decided to get the iphone c the price was the best online ive had it for a few months and it works great it looked brand new i came very fast it had a clean esn and was easy to connect to att i love this phone i now trust this company and will reorder again if i upgrade to another phone or electronic thankyou very much,positive
otter box has the best cases,positive
beyond my expectations for the price company has fast excellent customer service the phone is fast and the battery life is incredible compared to other phones ive had a great plus to this is that you can order more batteries from neoixcom at a good price highly recommend this phone,positive

i am very pleased with the blu life  xl i needed a unlocked phone so i could change my carrier and that is what caught my attention about the blu phones i had tried another of blu phone but it seemed to hang occasionally when i was changing apps or using the browser i purchased that phone locally and they allowed me to return it when i discovered the octocore i thought that such a setup would work for me it did i added a  gig memory card and loaded this phone up with apps the phone has worked well the i have not had any problems with service on my carrier i realize that the phone does not have gorilla glass and some other addons found in    dollar phones but for a guy who has a limited budget this phone has worked for me i liked it so well i purchased a second one for my wife,positive
ive always been a fan of the iphone series in fact the last one i had was the iphone s plus but i recently traded it out for the samsung galaxy s edge this phone is amazing and is lightning quick it has  it is very responsive to your touch and the  inch screen makes it a breeze to read whatever your doing on the phone i am highly satisfied by this phone i think samsung really outdid themselves this time,positive
there is nothing that i do not like about this phone this blows them all away for the money my friend samsung s does less and is not even expandable he paid  the ease of use of this phone and the size really got me my hands are huge so nothing less will do this phone is solid well built extremely clear screen the cameras front and rear are amazing volume very loud which is great for me i work in a loud environment over all if you are looking for the real deal this is it one more thing it does wifi to a wifi printer for your pics and stuffa,positive

i am coming from a sony z and this is a breath of fresh air some people do not like the os skin but i think it is one of the best aftermarket skin options out there some people are not  am not comfortable with it but it is a winner i bought this for the camera and it is exceptional usb c is a nice touch with quicker charging and in all a very well spent upgrade,positive
awesome i have not figured out the technology differences between the the s and the previous models like live photos but the phone is still awesome,positive
i bought this phone from marketplace seller gothams cells it has  it is the model destined for taiwan so the phone out of the box was configured in chinese you have to go into settings to change the language to say english unfortunately android is a pain to use and each version sports a very different ui this one runs android i got the phone primarily as a sync device for my beloved sony a camera secondarily i use it as a backup phone to my iphone android is very hard to use and configure but this is one of the best android  phones ive tried it runs fast and is very responsive sometimes googles play store is really slow but i know it has  it is googles fault not the phones because id be on the same wifi network and in the same wifi range and the firefox browser runs fast all the timeif you have a sony mirrorless camera like the alpha series you need to download two apps from the play store playmemories mobile for downloading photos and videos from the camera and optionally playmemories online to upload the images to sonys cloud drive gb for free of course you can forego the latter and sync the photos from the phone to your computer i use a mac utility sony provides in addition to autosyncing to playmemories online cloud storage id have preferred a way to sync to icloud but so far i have not found a trustworthy way android is full of spyware and trojans and viruses and everybody says google spies on its users which worries mewithin the confines of being an android phone this is an excellent smartphone i recommend it,positive
very good product and delivered in a timely manner,positive
delivered as expected in great condition only i had to return it because it is not unlocked to use with tmobile for data and web usage we could only make and receive calls with this phone and we needed the phone for the other features my request for return was quickly accepted no problems im very happy about the experience,positive
a buddy of mine referred this phone to me and i absolutely love it i was getting over how expensive and nondurable the iphones were getting and i just had to switch i wanted to switch to android but i decided to try this out for a change the phone in itself has a very sturdyquality feel to it i just recently got this phone a few days ago and i already dropped it once the screen did not crack even though it landed face first into the ground the screen still works perfectly fine thank goodness i was skeptical about the battery life since it has  it is not a well known phone but it lasts boy does it last the old phones that i used to have used to die around midday from the amount of usage that i would output but this phone just keeps running and keeps up with me throughout the day it has  it is a very reliable little bugger definitely a quality buy for sure,positive
bought as used verygood condition looks and work like new excellent thank you,positive
my biggest plus on this phone is the camera and the speed at which you can switch between one application to the next once you grasp how to use the phone,positive
loving it since the functionality exceeds pricing lets hope im able to upgrad it to  so far it is the best windows  phone,positive
the iphone is working good looks like new thanks,positive
great quality product,positive
it was so nine and i love it,positive
very good phone works nice,positive
an great product very recommendable,positive
i want to start off by saying i have owned a lot of phones in my day and this phone has to be my favorite android to date the stock andoid covered with the zen ui is just a pleasue to use and can be fully customised to your liking that along with the gb of storage make this phone a phone lovers dream phone with  gigs of ram this phone will perform flawless even under stress of heavy gameing the quick charger will always keep your phone juiced up too my phone chargers in about  mins from almost deadnow for cons the battery is minimal for a phone this powerful they should have had a way bigger battery but that has  that is not to say this phone will not last you all day its just not the greatest battery life i have seen but i guess they had to cut costs somewhere right  this phone is great and i would highly recommend this phone to anyone who loves fast great performing phones with quick charging that is not ,positive
probably the only thing ive purchased in the last  years that is exactly as advertised,positive
its my daughters phone and she loves her droid the only issues she has with it is it will not accept pix messages and we cant figure out why but everthing else is cool with it so far and its been about a month now,positive
great price on a defender otterbox fits s perfect and color is very vibrant,positive
great phone came with the latest version of android lollipop everything was there and i m using it on tracfone so if you are wondering it will work there my concerns were that it would cost me but turn on wifi only and turn off data i send texts using gmail and make calls using hangout dialer so the only time this costs me anything is when i accept a text message or accept a phone call even then i can see who it is and call them back for free using dialer i also have majik jack as another backup for free calls my last phone with tracfone cost me about  a year so i figure this one should be about the same the phone itself has  sim card slots so you could have  phone numbers if you want or if traveling out of the country just buy a nd sim for the country you are visiting i added the g sd card so have lots of room there just wish more android apps would transfer over without rooting which i did not do camera video and gps are very good and overall i would recommend this phone,positive
excellent product i had s and now s very satisfied again,positive

it works fine here in curacao island of the dutch colony in the caribbean so its totally unlocked it has two sim card slots that are the full size sim so u dont need to cut your sim card or you need an adaptor to make it normal so it can fit the slot comes with one battery one earpiece one usb cable and a plug to make the usb attach to electricity and one transparent screen protector its a nice phone for the price opens pages relatively fast has opera software googleplay front and back camera has different languages you can choose from the start from english spanish etc i recommend it,positive

we have  f these  are new purchased and  are old chose those these because of service from old ones,positive
initially when i bought this device i was extremely worried from the bad reviews i saw out there reviewers were saying the device overheats the screen was awful camera was terrible and many many other things as an htc user i use to know the quality of the devices they make so i find these statements totally shocking compared to what i bought in the past form them so i decided after many hours of thinking and double thinking to give htc a chance based on my previous experiences with their devicesafter a month of use i do not regret my decision there have been several updates form htc and each one of them have improved the aspects people were complaining about overheating got severely reduced without affecting the device performance at least that i can notice with a cooler device battery life also improved there have been some improvements to the camera making it decent to use in auto mode manual and raw mode are impressive giving very good details on what you can control and edit after the photography has been taken the screen rant was basically for nothing the screen is bright enough to look over direct sunlight viewing angles are very good and color reproduction is accurate sound quality is superb the best out there in a smartphone ive heard hands down this  a good gamepad  the good screen makes it an outstanding combo for media consumption and gamingthis does not means it has  it is the perfect phone with some competition like the galaxy s and the lg g it will depend from you on which one to get what you can be sure about is any of these will make you happy as i said the updates do not mean the phone is perfect now there is still space to improve and you should be aware of the following for some people the screen looks so washed out because it does not has too much contrast this can be improved by software though the camera still needs a lot of work on details when zooming the closer you get to  zoom or crop the more serious the problem becomes normal scaled pictures are fine though battery life it has  it is not perfect yet and data connection drains battery so much making it last sometimes less than m however the duration is actually on par to the s or the gabout these there are some leaks from android  update already and they show an insane improvement on camera and battery departments so if you are still deciding id encourage you to wait for this update to be released to confirm if they are true,positive
everything great,positive
this watch is cool for the price it is worth every penny it is hooked to everything in my phone although i could not figure out the browser i dont think they even made it to work instead of looking up bt notification apps in the play store wait until your watch arrives and turn it on scroll through and you will see an app qt scan it and the app works flawlessly i can connect to my phone from the watch with this app all the other apps never worked so do not waste your time as for the looks it is amazing not too bulky or uncomfortable sleek and the touchscreen works great,positive
phone as advertised,positive
great price and phone in great shape,positive
arrived on time and the phone works perfectly no complaints,positive
some said it would never catch on but here we are four years on from the original galaxy note phablet with the fourth generation device  the samsung galaxy note the galaxy notes big screen and s pen stylus are certainly not for everyone the samsung galaxy s and galaxy alpha offer a more mainstream smartphone setup  the note  brings together big power a big screen and big productivity,positive
excellent cellphone great screen,positive
great phone and fast good wifi reception and clarity of speech used magic jack to call friends located micro sd slot on top of sim  expandable to gig i am running gig all apps from galaxy s ported over rather quickly via google account verizon and sprint do not work with this phone they are cmda fyi sim  g sim  g att and tmobile are supposed to work but tmobile reviews say that only voice and text have not tried it out i use straight talk and will use att the only con is it does not have g for secure banking via phone my area does not have much g anyway the phone that i received says north america which includes mexico canada central america and has to be activated for  minutes on a north american carrier before it can be used overseas i have used other phones in eastern europe with no problems they run on g leave sim  open if you travel to europe there will not be a problem with this one,positive
this works perfectly on our sailboat,positive
excellent condition it was as described and arrived on time,positive
no problems just what i was looking for great size shape and overall feel in the hand just like an iphone but better recommend getting the cordless charging station  it makes charging so easy and also helps me keep track of the phone so i dont leave it around the house and lose it i initially liked the fingerprint id to unlock but found that i use my hands so much that it became less reliable that has  that is my only disappointment other than that lightning fast and high quality from samsung highly recommend,positive
am a satisdied customer i always got what was offer to me in perfect condition and the excepted date,positive
great phone love the screen and colors are outstanding,positive
i highly recommend i would give  stars if i could,positive

love the phone so far my only qualm is periodically calls cannot be made because of a sim error in which i must disable and then enable the simweird also the phone does not work properly with a screen protectorthe screen goes dark during calls so i removed the screen protector as i could not end a call with it on,positive
i have both phones and have used both for a few months nowwife has the blu and i have the motogbottom line i would prefer the blu only if it had fit into my jeans pocket which is does but uncomfortablybelow are some pro and cons comparing the two if i did not list a certain subject that means they both are about equal or it really did not matter to mepros  screen gives more than the extra  gain with the  moto g screen the  lower buttons home back properties is on the screen thus taking up space with the blu the touch buttons are off the screen just below it freeing up about another so in actuality the gain in screen size feels quite significantkeyboard haptic feedback feels betterphone is thinner and looks sleeker too cheaper with more accessories included headphones back case screen protector chargercons jellybean with no way to move apps to the sd card without rooting no issues regarding screen resolution it has  ppi slightly less view angles and screen color temp is a bit cooler bluishbattery run time is slightly less a whole day  hour light use drains the battery to about update the battery usage is not as bad as i thought we now end up around  with light usage all day which is on par with the moto g lteone new downside we found was the video recording being poor in low light indoors the moto g was able to up the gain to get to the proper brightness while the studio  lte video was dark i do not think this is due to jellybean vs kitkat but probably more of a hardware issue still a minor issue for me,positive
excellent product good service arrived sooner than expected thank you,positive

great phoneeven without the removable battery and expandable storagei bought the i model for europe  works all the bands form the main carriers except g band   but no longer used by my operator  so i did not mindthe phone comes without any bloatware  so greatwatch out as the i while international is more or less targeted for philippinesmalaysiaindonesiavietnam etc  more or less that part of asiabecause of this language support in the phone is regional to what is found there  englishukusthe phone comes with a  pin pluguk style  so based on your country you might need an adapter for iteverything else is as expected,positive

hi first lets setup my parameters i am a tmobile subscriber from tampa bay area my reception is the highest available i have owned in order a ericson from the pcs days a panasonic from attcingular days nokia   tmobile dash tmobile shadow nokia n gb for  weeks but then the display went out and i got scared to want to replace it so i returned it please also note this is my second time owning a nokia  the first time was a european model with us warranty since i got it from the nokia flagship store in chicago that had the first firmware with no updatesand it sucked sucked so bad i sold it used because i couldnt wait for the firmware upgrade so now we advance to today and with great relief i tell you people that this nokia  nam is an outstanding smartphone the most current firmware  has made this nok great i know this because i have owned both i take off  because no the ui is not as pretty as the iphone nothing is when it comes to touch the other  is because when you activate the pretty animations for the touch interface it does slow it down so i do turn it off to keep it running smoothly this is a best seller for nokia therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother their is no crazy ear piece problem the phone feels so easy fitting in one hand this cant be said of the iphone the iphone is awsome yes but its kinda big to use as a cellphone ok let me real this in the phone works great clear loud speaker phone great fun snap shoot digital camera great flash abilities to stream web content great call quality very pretty screen as for the touch method the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is clearly improved and does not hold you back clearly the firmware upgrade tweaked the sensitivity and made it much more responsive im all over the place with this review im sorry if only nokia could do better marketin partnerships and get this to a local best buy so people can touch it and feel how great it isthat for me is one of it biggest selling points,positive

i love this cell phone especially the speaker phone i use it open all the time especially if im typing no feed back or tunnel feeling for the other person im speaking with plus i live out in the boonies and it has exceptional reception,positive
it has  it is a great device faster and long battery life the camara of  mb pixeles is fantastici strong recommend it,positive
the phone is almost new in the outside and functions perfectly the only drawback on my side is that the battery is very weak but of course i could not expect everything on the phone to be perfect for half its price so overall i am very happy with my iphone ,positive
old phone for this technology but still a cool phone reminds me of the blackberry,positive
everything went as planned,positive
best phone for the price,positive
can do a lot of things with this phone like play all my ps one vedeogames d  had a great time with it it was kinda addictive specially the flipboard app well bad thing i lost it n whoever found it never answered to give it back ,positive
everything was ok,positive
the samsung galaxy s edge got here on time and in great conditions it works great,positive
its very fast and very good quality of pictures and videos big  inch screen so have to use with bluetooth or hands free cant share audios from whatts app directly you have to open the audio from its location and then share it once you video or audio is playing you cant turn them off from swiping the main screen down like in samsung galaxy to take screen shot you have to swipe down the screen and then go to screen shot icon so when you are actually taking the screen shot you can not seen that picture or page,positive
this phone is great if you are sick of the over priced american phones that have very few options i owned a note  before this and i like this phone better i am getting g on tmobile in the dallastx area the gps works fantastic as well and no crashes or silly software issues that you usually get the only issue that i have is the camera it is not that great and the front facing camera has a very creepy beauty mode that makes your eyes look like saucers and blurs your skin the rear facing is decent but not anywhere as good as the lenovo vibe z pro i would recommend this phone to my friends,positive
nothng to complanexcellent product works like a charm,positive
definitely happy,positive
brought this for my daughter and it has been great we have not had any problems with the phone i think that the layout of the phone is good and the picture is great the phone she had before would not receive and send messages like it should and would not ring when called we were not sure if it was our network or the phone this phone has had none of those issues,positive
it works good for me but where can i get a new charging cable,positive
this is a great cell phone i love it,positive
before i decided to purchase this phone i did some extensive research by reading many reviews on amazon other websites and saw many many youtube videos some youtube videos were of people reviewing the phone on their own some from nokia and other reviews from other tech news agencieswhen i opened the box and picked up the phone it totally surprised me it looks cool it has  it is a little heavy and feels very nice on my hand it has  it is aluminum body makes it feel and look very slickive been using this phone for a month now and it has been great i just updated the software to belle which has some great features and it has some cool looking graphicsthe only thing i wanted to test right a way was the on screen keyboard which non of the reviews i saw covered it all of them showed the phone with the physical keyboard that is build on the phonewell let me tell you that the on screen keyboard is very well put together and it is very solid i do not make many mistakes as i write and now that i have been using it for about a month i can write much faster and with almost no mistakes at allthe os is very well put together works very well on this phone and i have been very happy with it the nokia ovi store is not rich with apps but it has some good and very useful apps that you can download i have download those that are developed by nokia and they work great maps and gps works very very well with this phone and it is very accuratethe mp camera is great on it takes very nice looking and very clear picturesthe great thing about this phone is that it is unlocked you can use this phone on any gsm network and it is compatible with tmobiles g and it may be compatible with atts g network as well but when i use the internet it says g which is as fast and the pages only take seconds to download the other great thing about this unlocked phone is that if you travel outside of us you can insert a local sim and avoid using international roaming charges from your us carrier also the apps do not automatically sync at all times so it will not use up your data or use up battery poweralso this phone stands up very well to the competition it has half of the sd ram memory and processor speed compared to other phones it is very fast and when compared with other popular phones it will impress you on how fast it is and how easy it is to use the ui on symbian bellethe battery is very good on it it will last about  days depending on how much data you use at g speed but if you switch the phone to the power save it will use g and edge this will conserve so much battery power that i used the phone for  days before i had to charge itoverall i love this phone and it has been great upgrade form nokia e when i showed this phone to my friends who use some of the most popular phones today they were impressed by it has  it is looks os and uimy recommendation would be to do your own research and the best one is from youtube videos you can see the phone in action and see it has  it is functionality but if you decide to buy one you will be surprised when you receive the phone it feels good on your hand and it looks very slick as i said before,positive

great device i was on the fence about purchasing the z because of the phones that were going to be announced at mwc but figure that in the worst case scenario i could return it boy am i glad i did not wait the announced phones by htc and samsung did not have anything to grab my interest curved screen gimmicks and iphone  ripoffs from samsung and htc just rerelased the same phone they did last year with a higher megapixel camera one that has  that is just as bad as before to top it off they all have the same specs which were only slightly better than the z and as someone who constantly heard why do you need a bit processor when your phone do not have  gig ram lol when he had an iphone  it has  it is funny to see android manufacturers pushing them now on phones that still have less than gigs of ramoverall the z has been the best android phone i ever owned faster than the m i owned before it same high quality build as the m and iphone with a camera that can best both in the right hands the waterproofing is just the icing one the cake i used to be a fan of sony ericsson back in the feature phone days but stop being a fan of them once they start to put out less than great smartphones but the z has won me back i still prefer ios to android but i am waiting to see if lollipop can win me over when sony pushes it out,positive

i wanted to switch from android to iphone and also switch to verizon  i was on the boost sprint network which had spotty coverage in my areaverizon has a  pre paid plan which is working quite well for me so farnow to the iphone  s i really like the  inch screen the iphone fits in my hand and it is easier to navigate all the apps i find typing with the keyboard much easier i always had trouble using the keyboard on my galaxy s even with different keyboards the iphone is not as customizable as android but i can live with that so far the battery has lasted over  days and is still at  this is since i activated it  days agotrue i am still setting it up but i will manually sync my iphone with itunes my android phone was driving me nuts always updating several times a day from google play my battery lasted around   to  days if the iphone is similar i will be happy all in all i am very pleased with my new pre owned iphone s buying from amazon warehouse or fulfilled by amazon is the way to go,positive
htc does it again i always loved the line of devices so buying the m was a nobrainer,positive
exellent it s a great cell i like my iphone works perfect l am very happy to buy it,positive
the  start rating i am giving this is considering that it is cheap for  bucks this is an amazing phone but you will be disappointed if you compare it to a  device like an iphone  or galaxy si am floored at the capability and quality at this price point honestly at this low of a price i expected that it would be a piece of junk that i would be sending it back the mass of positive reviews convinced my to give it a try after  months i am hooked on blu im never getting a phone on contract or overpaying for a phone againpro value for money camera quality android  minimal bloatware included silicon case and screen cover screen qualitycon a little slow,positive

i was so tired of having no external memory card slot and then samsung updated my s to their customized version of marshmallow features that once worked no longer work and i had to try something to improve the situationafter some deliberation i purchased the blu vivo  and i am really surprised how much ive gotten for  are you kidding me this is way better than my gs sorry samsung blu has my money and it may be a while before im backthe blu vivo  has a larger brighter screen is lighter a dual sim chip tray a lot of features the gs offers for a fraction of the price and the sim chip  tray doubles as an expandable memory slotthank you blu,positive

the box contain every things they sayexcept the key for the sim card slot,positive
excellent return on investmentfor  the specs are great and comparable to high end phones with  gb ram and quadcore processor you cannot go wrong the display is big and good it is a phablet with  inch display do not expect this to be the easy one to carry it fits in my jeans and easy to hold it there is a big difference between white and black the black one has matte rough surface on the back and easy to hold the white one is smooth and bit challenging to holdon the quality control it looks like there are some issues i bought a phone and returned it the reason was it was not connecting to my home wifi whenever i come home i had to restart each time i come home apart from this the phone did not allow me to use  step authentication of gmail when opened brand newthe second phone did not have either issues but the screen protector installed has lot of bubbles and i cant seem to find a way to get rid of themoverall the hardware is great and pictures look ok for daily usage the audio is good on speakers and the call clarity is good yes the display doesnt offer high density but it is still good i dont see much difference this and my previous phone nexus  it serves the purpose exceedingly well especially on att network i am with cricket which uses att network and has lte all over the place,positive
what a deal for a full service smart phone i love it,positive
i live in brazil and this product it has  it is just what i need for travel over the world i use it when im out of hotel to see emails and navigate and it uses few quantity of data attention you have to set your phone or tablet to not download automatically photos and all other things you have to set your wifi as a cellphone hotspot if you do not do that your phone will think that has  that is a normal wifi and will use a lot of data,positive
loved it great performance,positive

this phone was more than i expected my daughter loves it i will definitely purchase again seller is awesome,positive
christmas gift for my techi son who was tired of apple phones,positive
while ive only had this a few days so far it has  it is far better than i expected a few notes about some issues users report the phone as of  did not work on metropcs so save your time at least not in my area tmobile and att are fine i believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs that has  that is incorrect it will work on any network that accepts unlocked gsm phones the usb charger is not hard to work around all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug take a hardware store razor blade and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part it has  it is really not difficult and there has  there is no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable i just cut away at about a  degree angle and a standard cable fit fine the case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other without this cable mod the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable with it it has  it is fine standby battery life is quite good but when you use it for anything the battery drains fast but that has  that is why it only weighs  grams you cannot expect a tiny battery to have a long life that has  that is not realisticthis little phone is amazing they have actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingersin terms of size this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone i havei cannot think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc and for me i prefer this small size i almost never carry my full sized smart phone because i just do not like that sizei will not know for a year how durable this thing actually is but honestly at the price i do not even care if it fails you can buy  of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy and they are not  am not nearly as adorable,positive
for  years i was strictly sony ericsson all the way from the t to the ki my k was incredibly buggy so i decided to give the n a go and never looked back after nearly a year there were just aspects where the  did not do things id like it to do namely extended text entry so i figured why not give the full qwerty a chance again never looking back in terms of my mobile needs this phone meets and exceeds all of them it has  it is great for listening to music however for extended sessions i do bring a dedicated music player this thing gets a gps lock lightning quick my n would take upwards of a minute to two while often times i blink and google maps has already located me the camera leaves much to be desired however i was never content with any of my previous phones k k n which had incredibly impressive cameras for their time i only rely on cameras in phones for the rare times where i want to capture something but have not brought a camera with me or one is not allowed in terms of actually talking on the phone i try not to do that not because of any flaws i just prefer cell phones for their features rather than the phone aspect it has  it is flawless ive yet to have a dropped call or reception problems my only gripe is with s not the phone in particular caller id pictures are handled horridly if you buy this phone be sure to look into fs caller id check google for full screen caller id images,positive
the best phone ever made,positive
easy to work figured it out in no time love the touch screen was afraid to upgrade but baby steps,positive
great phone so far at a great price,positive
love it meet my expectations,positive

this phone was very inexpensive compared to retail value it got to me and appeared to be in brand new condition even though it said it was used the shipment got from new york to texas in  days i was very pleased with this purchase the only thing was that when you recieve this phone unlocked it does not allow you to lock the phone with a password other than that it was perfect,positive
great value for money,positive

the phone is big great and everything a cell phone should be poeple ask me can they check it out to much get your own lol ,positive
this model a little sturdier for teenage boy so when his original had issues with the charging connector that would also require screen replacement was same or less to just buy same model this arrived in good condition in time frame stated and was not that difficult to switch over ourselves with current provider connection,positive
love itbut my headphones port went bad after a few days the color is so sexy n classy works well,positive

my daughter loves it,positive
very good product,positive
good sell good iphone thankyou,positive
i bought this used through amazon warehouse deals to save money it came in the box just like new good price no signs of wear on the phone as an upgrade from the s i would say i am overall happy with the s it is lighter faster and bigger so no complaints there i bought this to use on the ting network which saves me a lot of money on my phone bill my average bill is  a month for full service the difference is that i pay by usage as long as i do not go crazy with data calling texting etc my bills stay low the highest bill i have ever had was  some bills were as low a  so i recommend saving the money on an expensive cell phone plan and using this great iphone from apple,positive
ive used other smartphones before and i can say blackberry  is the most complete os ive used for my needs one of the things that most impressed me was when i was playing youtube on battery saving mode while attempting to record a video the os notified me resources were not available at the time and proceeded to stop recording the video the multitasking aspect of the os is handled at the kernal level blackberry  is built off qnxunix technology each application is segmented this prevents the os from crashing and shutdowns the application of lower prioritybeing able to compose documents without needing to look at the keyboardimportance of the trackpad i did not think i would use the trackpad often but i realize how accurate and useful it is first having the ability to flip through the os and scroll webpages without your thumb running interference with what you are viewing is nice second having the ability to place the cursor exactly where your want it and quickly cut and paste is a positivei thought the phone would feel bigger based on some reviews but the size is perfecti appreciate the hard back button when browsing the webvideo played better than expected the app fast tube is awesomethe camera is better than expected it gets the job done for what i will be using it for spontaneous pictures when im out and about the video and photo editing features are solid for a smartphonewebpages render nicelyin summary i would of switched to blackberry a few years back but they we are behind the game im glad i made the switch now considering their advancements in the os which i cannot say enough positive things abouti typed this review on my classic using word to go after one day i really started to appreciate the keyboard the initial few hours were slow but im getting faster by the hour for new users considering switching to a qwerty keyboard you should realize it will be a little slow and awkward at first but you will become comfortable with it in no time going forward i will use my blackberry to send the vast majority of my emails,positive
exactly as expected,positive
i have my grand since two months ago and i love it the cellphone goes very well i have been testing many games and it has no problem running the games you will love the camera is great and it has many options to take a picture i enjoy selfie mode it is very nice and original you can use ur hand or ur voice to take a picturelow price to a great smartphone ,positive

so ive had lots and lots of unlocked phones with crickets service over the years and i have noticed a few common themes among them all unlocked phones tend to be cheaply made and for the most part are hit or miss out of the box but this phone beats the competition out of the water by a mile and a half ive only had this phone for about two months as of me writing this review but this is the single most amazing phone ive ever had im telling you now if you have the money to invest into this phone even if it has  it is financed with something like amazon credit it is worth every pennymy favorite feature though is the camera the display is not only p but the camera can shoot k images just unbelievable heres a few photos to show you what you are getting for your money,positive

i just bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it the only issue i had is her old phone had a mini sim and this one takes a larger version so instead of waiting to order a sim adapter since att and bestbuy both told me they could not help me i took the matter into my own hands what i figured out is the sim  goes in the top slot and a tray is below it for sim  so i then side my sim card in the first slot with the sim chip facing down then to hold it in place i put a piece of scotch tape over it once you put the battery in the sim is snug in placei have a blu vivo air which i love but i have to say for the price this phone is really great i could have down way worse for the same price,positive

everyrhing alright,positive
im so glad i bought this fantastic phone ,positive
this is the first time ive gotten an unlocked phone and ill do it again i like the way google has it configured like the way it feels in my hand love the fingerprint sensor most of the time and am otherwise enjoying it initially i only gave it  stars because of the battery life im not a heavy user at all and it did not last a full day but i read other reviews that said to let the battery run down and then charge fully i did that and it has  it is lasting much longer plus it uses a rapid charging system when the battery is low going to full in a very short time like  minutes so now im a happy camper without any complaints,positive
thank you,positive
great so far,positive
how  get owners manuel tommy,positive
i bought this phone no issues whatsoever works great original samsung,positive
my battery started to not hold a charge for very long and was hard to communicate listen to music play pokemon go or even have the screen brightness up this replacement comes with a carrying case and a charging case i wish it would have had its own charger but not a big deal it seems to have fixed my battery because now they both last almost as long as one another and i use the same charger as before great buy,positive
omg i love the phone  its an awesome deal and i highly recommend it to everyone,positive
the phone is really amazing it is fast and has it all as it was shown on apple event im very very satisfied with my iphone ,positive
great buy delivered on time product received as described,positive

it does the job pretty good the only negative is that sometimes i get pictures and it does not want to download it states is low on memory i tried several options and so far nothing  other than that great phone able to use any country and double sim,positive
great case that does not add a lot of bulk to the phone,positive
just purchased this refurbished phone after my other galaxy had an accident and broke description said excellent condition and truly the phone looks good as new working very well so far only had to pop in my sim card and go,positive

for basic calling and text sending great work,positive
got phone on time and worked perfectly,positive
this is a great phone for the money i do not think i can go back to motorola after this,positive
great phone bought it used and its extremely clean and quick much faster than i anticipated and im guessing it has  it is because of the gbs of ram and core processor screen is beautiful and my colleagues thought it was comparable to an iphone s due to size and quality was worried about it working with att but i ran it against a friends iphone s also on att and it beat itonly thing i do not like is the vibrate while typing ive turned it off im settings but it has  it is still vibrating if someone has a solution to this please let me know,positive
did have some miner damage but nothing too noticeable i love my new phone,positive
the size is perfect for average guy it has  it is large enough for typing w  thumbs and small enough for use w one handthe phone is light so it does not bounce around in pants pocketthe battery life is good for a lite user with cell data mostly off i typically get  daysthe case design allows secure fit for the soft shell while exposing the forward facing speakers make sure to get a shell or it might not survive a dropthe only downside is the sd card it is in the same tray as the sim card when i take it out to transfer large files sometimes it takes a few tries to get both cards aligned when inserting,positive
its only been about a week but i love this phonepros its fast and fluid the software feels light even went loaded up with music and apps very smooth transitions between apps and when scrolling or swiping with it having next to no bloatware at all i get to control exactly what apps are on my phone and not be pestered with relentless updates for apps i do not even use that just take up space on my device the os is simple easy to use and small i think its gb so even if you have the gb version i got the gb version you have plenty of space for your music and apps while still allowing enough memory space for the phone not to feel bulky and slow the finger print scanner works very well is lightning fast and lets me store many different fingers so i can set my index of each hand the camera is well made and takes good shots that feel a bit warmer than colors available which is nice for me phone feels well made in my hand and i can reach the whole screen with one hand the batter easily lasts all day with moderate usage and the fast charging is greatcons it needs all new charging devices and only comes with a power charging usb so unless you have bluetooth on your computer you cannot import or export music phones etc without buying a separate cord for  my computer would not recognize it at first which turned out just to be a driver install but my computer did not automatically suggest the install i had to go to googles website and download manually only took  min to troubleshoot but if you are not tech savvy this may be  min or so for you feel slippery in my pocket might need a case to keep from slipping out when i sit down,positive
i used xperia ray then went to iphone after that choose galaxy siii then change operating system bought nokia lumia  everything was right except lacking of applications in wp system i came back to android and was waiting for something stylist and has good features finally i found sony xperia zl and the best part of it i can use any networkim now using simple mobile and it has  it is wroking greatso far no problem love the phone,positive

i bought this phone for my son i was a little worried that i put off the order for so long that he would not get it when i wanted him to have the phonei placed the order the phone was sent out the same day the delivery date was further out than the time frame i was hoping for but it was me who ordered last sec the phone came early before school started with everything the dealer said would come with itwe are happy satisfied customersmy son always tells mei love my phone,positive
this phone is incredible there is no way to describe it besides the best the only thing that i do not like about it is the battery the battery is not very good for all day heavy use but it will get you through the day as long as you do not use it all day and use the power saver option it is smaller than the original htc one but not by much i do not really see it as mini many people complain about the camera which is not a concern for me because it has  it is actually very good and it has a lot of fun effects if you want a great camera then buy an actual camera it has  it is great to quickly capture those important moments a thing that i love on this phone is google now totally check it out it has  it is such a treat to have the graphics on this phone absolutely blow me away and so do the speakers all of my friends and family are really jealous of my mini even when they have awesome phones,positive

its great for the pricescreen very sharpperformance  overall very responsive and fast stutters once in a while when you have demanding apps running in the background but that is acceptable given the specs i have nova launcher bunch of custom notification processes push email google sync running at the same time it stutters only when i have a bunch of apps open as well so i would say its greatcamera fixed focus very basic you did not buy this for its camera so dont worry abt itbuild solid feel a little heavy but completely acceptable,positive

this smart watch by jersa is a nice little watch although i was not actually able to go online with this phone because i was having technical issues not allowing me to access full use of this cool watch i did contact the company and they was more than helpful and willing to assist me in fixing the issues it is easy to get into to put your card in and comes with a instruction pamphlet it has a nice durable band that adjusts for different size wrists easy to turn on and off and slides from side to side to access the windows great company to work with,positive
purchased this for my husband he loves it works great received it in plenty of time for christmas,positive
first off thumbs up for the seller very accurate now this device is truly amazing completely new and unlocked and the ui is incredible running on jb users might not need any customization however i did install next launcher d just to check the smoothness and all i can say iswow pebble blue color is pretty much the same as its bigger brother s the wifi is great and fast network reception is too awesome camera i must say pretty impressive now for gaming this device with dual core can take some pretty heavy graphics i installed shadowgun deadzone and this device delivered people crying about this device being laggy totally not true and the battery is decent but i am always using it either with games music or the cameravideo the battery will last you about  days with normal use durability is great already dropped it a couple of times of course with the dual armor case equipped and not a single scratch trust me when i say that this device is worth buying you shall  you will come to find that for a midrange phone the little brother of the s can indeed deliver heavy kicks recommendations thrown out to everyone,positive
everything was excellent the cellphone came all perfect with all its accesories i have no complaints it was delivered on time and works perfect here in venezuela thank you so much,positive
great phone great deal,positive
so far i am very happy with this phone i am planning to get an s active once i can buy an unlocked version they are not  am not available yet but this is a nice upgrade in the meanwhilepreviously i was using an s active this s is faster and more efficient nice and thinlight although i do use a case on it so it takes away the nice slim and sleek appearance of the phone screen is beautiful it takes great pictures and has plenty of camera settings very responsive to touch without any glitching and no need to tap multiple times for touch to register etc battery life has been surprisingly good even with heavy use of internet messaging games email etci was not sure about using the thumbprint unlocking and account verification features but it has worked flawlessly so farthe interface and layout is easy to navigate and find what you needwant getting to the settings to personalize things is pretty straightforward and just makes sense the way things are categorized etc i was able to set mine up and have all the settings how i wanted them in just a few minutes i did go through and check everything out to see what differences there were from the layout on my s active there are some subtle changes but not enough to make it difficult to figure outi transferred everything from my old phone by using the quick connect feature so much faster than bluetooth it is almost instant made it so easy and saved so much time pics videos contacts documents everything was faster and easieroverall i am very happy with this phone i have not come across anything that i do not like or that is difficult confusing etc if anything changes ill update,positive
handy item,positive
this item is at very conditions working good thanks,positive
great budget phone i have owned samsung and apple and i have to say this phone is right up there with the best but without the big price tag i have owned a blu phone in the past and had a very good experience with this product brand so far i love everything about this phone the only con i have is with phones cases they do not have a big selection to choice from i will use the one that came with it until i can find something better,positive
it is simple and reliable im so happy to have it definitely it has met my values this product is the best,positive
only draw back is battery life otherwise a great phone i would recommend if battery life is not a big deal to you i basicly need to charge it every day to every  days depending on use,positive

the iphone is simple to use and works great plus this model does not have the lightning adapter which seems to be more trouble than it has  it is worth cables cost twice as much video and audio out are limited compared to the  pin and aftermarket products can be difficult to come by,positive
excellent product great customer service when i had to return it would recommend it and would definitely buy again ,positive
switched from a galaxy s mini to this one since i was slowly becoming incompatible with recent tech this phone is a little longer than the s but still perfect pocket sizethis phone does use a micro sim card not the standard sim card size so be prepared to get a new one if you are buying this,positive

the amazon price was the best available at the time of my purchase combine that with free shipping and this is a really great deal for those who want a gsm phone that has a decent camera is simple to use and has a reasonably small form factor i am using mine on the att network currently i was previously using a sony ericsson wa which had been giving me a multitude of problems i wanted a simple unlocked phone that would work with my voice and text plan but i did not want to go backwards in camera resolution or expandable memory capabilities additionally i did not want to renew my contract with an upgrade from att just in case i want to switch carriers in the near future i do not have a data plan and pretty much only talk and text from my device this phone does both very well the reception and voice clarity are superior to that of my previous sony ericsson the nokia interface is not as aesthetically refined as the sony ericsson was but it is simple and reliable i will take functionality over beauty if i have to choose between the two some nice extras are the inclusion of a  mm audio jack and a micro usb port which can be used for charging and data transfers i hate proprietary jacks the only problems i had were in configuring the mms internet and media net settings since this phone has never been sold by att they will not provide any technical support however once i found some instructions for the configuration it was easy to get all features running smoothly this was a great buy here is what you have to do to get the mms and internet connectedmenumessagingmessage settingsmultimedia messagesreq read reports  noallow read report  nomms creation mode  guideddefault slide timing  mms reception  automaticallow adverts  noconfiguration settingsconfiguration  personal configaccount  media netsettingsconnectivitypacket datapacket data conn  when neededpacket data settingsactive access point  access point edit active access ptalias for access point  access point packet data acc pt  wapcingularconfigurationpersonal config settoptionsadd new  access pointaccount name  my access pointaccess point settingsbearer settingspacket data acc pt  wapcingularnetwork type  ipvauthentication type  secureuser name  leave blankpassword  leave blankconfigurationdefault config sett  personal config checkedact def in all apps  yespreferred access point  my access pointpersonal config settmedia netaccount name  media netserver address  use pref access point  noaccess point settingsproxy  enabledproxy address  proxy port  bearer settingspacket data acc pt  wapcingularnetwork type  ipvauthentication type  secureuser name  leave blankpassword  leave blank,positive

i have been using an apple iphone s plus for  months now its the most beautiful and nice phone i ever have it is fast and easy to use i love the display of it especially when i am watch a movie it has  it is thinner and lighter than all cellphones i used to own it is to carry in your packet or hold in your hand i really like the fingerprint ring on home button which helps you to get in your phone quickly and it makes easy to access your cellphone it takes less time to charge it which is more convenience to me and when the battery is full it last for long time for instance me i charge my iphone once a day because the battery last for a day or two moreover i love taking pictures with my iphone because it has the best camera that i never had in my previous cellphone it has hd camera that brings the quality i want furthermore i listen to the music a lot the speaker of iphone s plus is good it brings out the good sound that i enjoy it also if you like to use headphone to listen to the music in the setting app you have opportunity to choose the type of sound you want to hear for example pop rock jazz etc also it boost your base for certain amount when connected to a speaker or headphone the touch screen is better than other phone i had before because it respond quick and does not delayalthough its the best cellphone i ever have or use the price is kind high for me its an expensive cellphone but the way it is and the way it woks it deserves to be expensive i love everything about it for real,positive
thank you its a great phone its the best xperia i never had d and the original headset sounds goooooooood,positive
what happen the box from my iphone c,positive
great little phone got this for teenage son for first phone does the job is unlocked used with tmobile prepaid no issues at set up does have dual sim at least the blue one did can use business number on one sim and personal number on other sim does not fit my needs but thought id mention it battery is nice and long no decent instructions come with it so just takes time to figure everything out can lock the keypad by pressing the top left corner control button and the  key however this does not prevent the phone from shutting off if the power button is held down i do not like that fact but it has  it is the only real complaint j have the radio works well and my son has managed to get music on a mini sd card loaded into the phone so it acts as an mp has a camera but he and i do not believe you can send or receive photos at least we have not been able to durable little phone my son is clumsy and drops things a lot so this one has held up for a month so far with no issue no internet access on this phone this was the whole reason we purchased it did not feel  yr old should have access to the entire world in the palm of hand lot of responsibility there and with this generations focus to validate self through social media waned to keep his focus on his real life accomplishments and face to face interactions with friends he will go through those motions on his own as all teens push for that freedoms and experience be for now while he is still on the younger side of teenage years this phone works wonderfully for us ps my son has taken our encouragement to be fun with his outdated type phone in school and often makes remark as it is his stone age phone enticing humor amongst his peers he says he does not mind it being outdated and even likes that it has  it is a little sturdier than his friends of course he does dream for an iphone but just thought id mention it in case any other parents out there were in the same place i was and worried your child might hate you for an outdated phone they will not they know you love them and are thinking in their best interest it shows hope this review details enough for any type i future buyer,positive
i would have given this  stars but because it does not support android pay i am only giving it  other than that i really love the phone it has  it is fast the graphics are great the battery life is great the bluetooth works well and so overall im pleased but i cannot believe the phone with these specifications that has near field communications capability will not support android pay that was one of the primary things i was really looking forward to being able to useupdate from  stars to a  star rating i contacted blu support regarding the issue with android pay they acknowledged the issue and they were able to replicate the same problem on their end the notified the blu software team and corrected the issue im not sure what they did or if it was just a matter of getting google to add this new model to their trusted list either way the good news is that android pay is now working on my awesome super fast new blu pure xl and i love it,positive
i love this case it does make your phone bulkier but i actually like it it makes it look nicer ive wanted a mophie for the longest time but could not afford it but this offer made it possible for a poor college student to obtain it ,positive

this phone is working great for me so far at first i was a bit nervous to buy a refurbished phone but it looks like it is brand new and runs like it is brand new i was able to activate it with no problems at all i highly recommend this purchase to anyone that would like to buy a cheap top of the line smart phone major props to samsung for making this happen,positive
i love this phone i really do no complaints at all,positive
im very happy with it,positive

great service they call and verifies what phone i wanted would definitely recommend it again,positive
hard to give anything a  but this phone is smooth and so much of a step up from my old galaxy i was considering a samsung note or a iphone  plus but i liked the fact that this phone  while not water proof was at least water resistant and that it has a replaceable battery  both things are getting hard to find the fact that i am also a new tmobile customer might be adding to my satisfaction after verizon for almost  years i felt that they hung me out to dry because i was grandfathered with unlimited data they would not offer me a new phone or a decent priced plan so along come tmobile and while i had to buy my phone the plan is over  a month cheaper and gives me more data than i use verizon could have kept me but like a lot of businesses they do not value their existing customers i got a new phone that i love and trying a new service provider that is great so far,positive
having owned this phone for a few months now i can say that it is worth every penny while i do not play games on my phone that has  that is what computers are for i use it quite often for texting internet camera and general phone use the battery is exceptional even after months of use it still lasts  or  days between needing a charge originally the battery would last for about  or  days but all batteries degrade somewhat so this is to be expected the only thing i do not like about the phone is that the battery is not removable so when it finally goes you will need a new phone nevertheless i think that if this things lasts at least a year or more than it was well worth it the phone does everything i need to do it has  it is fast and has all the features of the big box brands i will definitely be buying another one when this one eventually fails or becomes obsolete as all phones do eventually great buy great company great phone please keep up the good work blu,positive
forgot to write a review but i still have the phone and has lasted over the years who needs smartphones,positive
as always i love samsung great phone and already have  update my updates come from poland on this phone but im in central america,positive
it came just as expected including the holder which i do not use i can see that bottom rubber under the hold button becoming loose in some time but so far so good this thing already saved my phone couple of times and the black and yellow color is aesthetically pleasing price is good too i would recommend this,positive
as with some of the reviews i read on herethe screen is a bit dark and cannot hardly see it in daylightthe phones finish is so slippery that it almost feels likeyou are trying to hold onto a bar of soap lolall of the games have a good feel like playing a pspit froze two times on me and of course reseted the thing twicedid not like thatgood gamingphonedevice thing i like it,positive

android lollipop on a budget this phone is great it keeps the preinstalled apps at a minimum but gives you what you need at the same time i will not list all of the specs of the phone here as you can see them on the product page but i will tell you that this is a nice looking phone it has smooth features and does not feel cheap the camera is awesome front and rear facing cameras too the screen on this is clear and responsive to touch i have owned many phones and this has the functionality of the higher end phones without the price tag this is actually less expensive than most deductibles on phone insurance policies and then they give you a refurbished phone anyway checkout the pictures and video for more details on the user experience the image of the two phones show the juning white next to an iphone  black for comparisoni received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review,positive
this is a great product it has  it is small but feels solid in your hand has a great battery i text a lot and i was used to having to charge my battery daily with this phone the battery lasts at least two days and that has  that is with heavy texting and limited internet usage well constructed shows conversational style text you can attach ringtones and photos to your contacts you can set up recurring appointments it has an alarm which works really well you can use up to an gb micro sd card with it if you have att service which i do you need to know how to configure it so that you can receive multimedia picture messages and access the internet i have the instructions for the configuration which i will enter below i would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a good phone but does not want to pay for a smart phone you can get unlimited data internet usage for month again att versus month for what they consider to be a smart phone okay it is not blazing fast on the internet uses edge rather than g or g but it has  it is fast enough for me i do not actually use it for the internet a lot because i prefer to use my computer for that multimedia messaging works great it does everything i want it to do and ive been used to using the samsung blackjack ii and jack ive been a cell phone user since  again i highly recommend this product instructions for configuring mms and internet webnokia c  mms and web settingsmultimedia messagingmenu  settings  configuration  personal settings  options  add new  multimedia msgaccount name att mmsserver address mmsccingularcomuse pref access pt noaccess point settings proxy enabled proxy address wirelesscingularcom proxy port bearer settings packet data acc pt wapcingular network type ipv authentication type normal user name wapcingulargprscom all capital letters password cingular all capital lettersnow go back to the personal settings personal accounts  options  activateinternetmenu  settings  configuration  personal settings  options  add new  webaccount name media nethomepage devicehomeuser name leave blankpassword leave blankuse pref access pt noaccess point settings proxy enabled proxy address wirelesscingularcom proxy port bearer settings packet data acc pt wapcingular network type ipv authentication type normal user name wapcingulargprscom all capital letters password cingular all capital lettersnow go back to the personal settings personal accounts  options  activateoh one more thingmake sure you order the one that has  that is sold by and fulfilled by amazon good luck and you are gonna love this phone ,positive

quality  excellent gorila glass on both sides beautiful and intuitive interface full hd super amoled  all sensors are working properly  compass gyroscope and others missing the pressure sensor so thin that it is unusual to raise from plane surfaces  camera very great shots with reasonable battery exploitation must withstand up to night if not to burden it with unnecessary processes you need to take in mind that the phone is very thin understood that the thickness of  at the expense of the battery capacity delivery in  days i am satisfied,positive

an avid smartphone user for  years now i bought this  this week to augment my berry for those weekends and other times when i do not need the full pocket computer rolling battery life has been solid so far need to still do a full rundown test yet the four bars keep staying on for a nice long time this review is a first impressiondo not let the s look fool you it has  it is packing g tmobile g for me underneath this fully global quadband factory unlocked package for not much more than a dualband i upgraded to the quadband for some planned travel this coming year and this should do the job quickly and happily while it has  it is nice to be unplugged from back home it has  it is a solid setup to be able to tie into web browsing and the email apps for google yahoo and exchange built in this will not replace your typical  touch screen device for video consumption however it loaded up my gb sd card that i use in my other device and played audio tracks within two minutesi do not see this replacing my smartphone needs with work and such however it has been a joy as a number two phone ideal for those nights out when you are expecting a phone calltext and may want to hop on the web while waiting in line or whatnot bust out this  and pop onto the xpress browser or email your friend on their big screen pocket computerphone and be prepared to see some shocked faces this thing cooks i wish that it would be sold in stores however im a happy amazon customer and this device seems to hit a nice medium between dumb phone and smart phone with sharp near landline call quality and quick t typingwith the ability to quickly swap out the sim from my berry to this  ive got a fun and useful duo for the same price as compared to upgrading to popular  gb models of other smartphones while using the latest iterations of some longtime players in this still relatively new fieldin sum im impressed i have not had a nokia since before my work blackberry days yet i can tell you this this is a great second sim phone for those of us tethered to those devices and a solid telecommunication device complete with up to date wireless tech baked in if you are looking for a phone that does the talking thing with a clear voice look no further,positive
upgraded from a nokia c to this smartphone lots to learn love the size of the screen and its clarity,positive
rally great product for the price it seems much better quality than what you can expect case earphone screen protector really great value i realized a couple of things now one it that it does not have gorilla glass screen so the protector is a must you cannot expect it with this price and second the screen protector has  layers of covers you have to remove one to stick to the screen and then remove the second one to expose the real protector this last layer is very difficult to peel of so you may think it has  it is not there and that ist a low quality film but once you work out to extract that layer the protector is very good,positive
i love this phone,positive

best product ever made by blackberry best phone around because it has a real keyboard compared to the glassvirtual keyboards of iphone and android i do not have to type and retype and then fix everything i type on this phone makes for much more pleasant texting experience the camera is good also the joysticktracking pad works so well it has  it is like working with a personal computer when you need to move the mouse arrowcursor or make edits this operating system is so easy to use probably better than the new blackberry os and way nicer than ios or android in my opinion  ,positive

i love this case it works perfectly when traveling and you do not want to carry a purse,positive
for an inexpensive phone this is packed full of features i was pleasantly surprised by the clarity of the photos taken with the camera the builtin flashlight mode and the was of customizing apps just the way i wanted them it also allows the phone to be set so that it can automatically turn itself off and on i have it power down at  pm and back on at  am to prevent spam calls i also downloaded my car app and i can start my car check the mileage and tire pressure and multiple other items from my phone for a  phone this is every bit as good the the samsung galaxy it is replacing but  less expensive the negatives the glass is not gorilla glass and fingerprints easily i had to download an app to turn off the obnoxious boot and signoff sounds overall this is a good value i was very impressed with battery life too,positive
the phone is great love it,positive

stock android delivers on exactly what i expected from the phone gb is good enough for my music needs front facing speakers are good for a phone with a decent case im able to manage the phone even with small hands fingerprint reader works well camera quality is good but maybe a bit slow this is offset by the excellent camera app with lots of software modes battery life is excellent and i rarely need to charge the phone during the dayi really wish that it had a memory card slot for expansion as opposed to large internal memory but it has  it is ok phone seems a tad bit fragile so i feel a decent case is a must it has  it is big so sometimes it has  it is awkward to fit in a pocket,positive

impressed with this phonehope to get a lot of use out of my moto,positive
got this a deal of the day for a great price the phone looks wonderful except for one small scratch on the front near the frontfacing camera that scratch is very small and only visible from certain angles i use the battery life app on my phone and the battery in the phone that i received tests out at  so no issues with the battery i was a little leery of buying a used phone but this phone has exceeded my expectations especially at the price i paid i would buy from this seller again,positive

ive been testing this out for work and the s is a brilliant mobileit has  it is easy if long winded if you opt to use the fingerprint scanner to setup and once connected to wifi it updated to android if you do take the the time to setup the fingerprint scanner youll benefit from fast unlocking without the need to enter a pin or screen code just pickup the phone pop your thumb on the sensor and it unlocksunlike the previous plastic s the s feels like a premium handset with a lovely design the only thing that might bug you is the camera around the back which sticks out a little bit from the back of the bodyinterestingly next to the rear camera is not only a flash but a small health sensor for measuring things like your heart ratesamsung have kept the s relatively bloatware free things like the health sensor make use of the included s health app and the apps pre installed all seem like they might be usefulunfortunately there isnt the option to add a microsd card however this is somewhat mitigated by being given gb of onedrive storage space free for  yearsthe camera on this is brilliant shots are lovely and clear the autofocusing works well you can pull focus to certain spots good depth of field you really wont need a dedicated camera if you have this in your pocketthe s also impresses when playing games the screen looks gorgeous and its big enough to allow the use of onscreen controls without your hands getting in the way of the actionworth noting the speakers are located on the bottom of the handset so if you are a gamer that plays a lot of landscape games you might find your hand covering the speaker and muffling the sound a littleit might not be the newest samsung phone but it still has a lot to offer its easy to see why samsung are doing so well in mobiles,positive
it worked as i was waiting,positive
i bought this for my mom who as a semitechnophobe refuses to upgrade to a smartphone it was a replacement for her last lg env which she loved that phone lasted her approximately  years it is a wellmade consistently reliable phone that most will find to be userfriendly the qwerty keyboard is great for those that prefer a physical keyboard to touchscreens,positive
this phone is great ive heard so many nice comments about it i heard that it is just like the galaxy note and those thing are the best i am getting mine on august th and i really cant wait ive searched for cases for this phone but it has  it is not many girl cases for it but otherwise the phone looks good without a case and for it to be a g phone it looks good and i know it works good,positive
excellent phone good price the team reached my country venezuela in good condition just place the sim card and it worked immediately me i recommend the only detail was that brought a couple of scratches nothing serious and that the charger is not the original but still worth it,positive

i bought this used through amazon warehouse deals to save money it came in the box just like new good price no signs of wear on the phone as an upgrade from the s i would say i am overall happy with the s it is lighter faster and bigger so no complaints there i bought this to use on the ting network which saves me a lot of money on my phone bill my average bill is  a month for full service the difference is that i pay by usage as long as i do not go crazy with data calling texting etc my bills stay low the highest bill i have ever had was  some bills were as low a  so i recommend saving the money on an expensive cell phone plan and using this great iphone from apple,positive
this phone is everything i thought it would be and more first big bright screen that has  that is  inches it also comes with octo core this feels like a more expensive phone for  dollars also people people seem to have problems with their phone burning out after a few weeks what i did was download due battery saver it let us you know when your phone is to hot it will also cool the phone down for you big phones tend to overheat,positive
this was a great phone,positive
love the phone,positive
a fantastic phonei have gone through three phones in the past  months  stolen  broken and as such have spent my time searching through the bargain phone section of amazon hunting down reviews and such to find the best phone for my buck i had the plain blu pure phone before i purchased this one and my last phone was good but not great the phone was thicker had poor battery life and an average camera so when that phone was stolen i decided to shell out an extra  for the xl and i am so glad i didbut enough backstory let us get to itprosthe phone is essentially a small tablet and the graphics are stunning and the large size makes it easy to typeread anything  i have had problems in the past trying to typeclick small icons in the corner of screens this phone does not have that problem extremely thin and light  makes carrying it around in a pocket easy it has  it is seriously skinny maybe the width of a pencilthe camera  no seriously the camera is the main reason i bought this phone it has  it is  mp back and mp front most phones only have a mp back this phones images are stunning and it has  it is light settings make every photo seem professional as an artist i am constantly snapping reference photos with my phone and so it has  it is important that they are good quality this phone does not disappoint even my selfies show all my pores in glorious detail the processor  makes it so every app ive downloaded runs quickly no chugging so far durable  ive dropped it a few times in the  weeks ive had it one time it even popped out of the case and onto concrete but no scratches or issuesconsthough i would and do highly recommend this phone there are always a few things that can be improvedthe camera placement  this is one of the few issues with this phone almost to the point where i considered deducting a star the camera is about the size of a dime on the back of the phone it protrudes slightly making it the part of the phone that touches the surface it has  it is placed on as a result it gets dirty quickly im also perpetually afraid of it getting scratchedlack of cases  blu is an offbrand phone so this is to be expected but there are almost no cases out there for the blu xl luckily one comes in the case with the phone though it has  it is a small flimsy plastic one and the cases ive seen so far do nothing to protect the camera i solved this problem with some handy beads and a hot glue gun but unless you are crafty cases can be an issue slippery  i fixed this problem when i customized my case with beads but i have small hands and the phone is smooth and large sometimes it can slip right out of your graspold operating system  it has  it is still running on jelly bean that does not bother me at all but some people do not like it my recommendation you can download apps from the play store that run the newer systems on your phone for you but jelly bean works fine honestly it has  it is more of an aesthetic choiceall in all this phone is the best out of the blu phones ive bought better camera great size etc i would recommend it over most samsung sony and iphones especially for the priceessentially you could pay for a name brand phone or pay  the price for a phone that works just as well if not better,positive
replaced the wifes aging sony xperia j with this good phone  extremely lightweight family owns several other blus all have proven good value for money  no problems with any of them reasonably fast smooth interface not much if any bloatware  good camera good display not for moronic phone snobs she has  she is a heavy texter uses it as her primary navigation device takes pictures and videos with it occasionally she even uses it as a phoneupdate i see some reviews up here from folks having trouble installingreading an sd card installingmoving apps bad displays etc this phone runs flawlessly it should certainly recognizeread a gb sd card and allow you to move apps off to that card i have noted no screendisplay anomalies it has  it is actually a pretty nice display and this phone in spite of my wife running about  apps at the same time  runs fine we are on att and it runs g the bluetooth interface works well in the car google maps andor here navi work fine etc  in short  id have to opine if you have trouble with this phone send it back immediately  because there are no native that i can find faultsdefectsand yes of course we have iphones samsung galaxies etc,positive

update this is a update on the polaroid  inch unlocked android smartphone i got the black one this time and i like it at first when i got this phone back months ago i did not like it because no one could understand what i was saying to them on the other end but i may have just got a bad apple because this works good and there is really nothing wrong with it the only thing i do not like about it is that camera is not all that good but it has  it is something you can over look over for a phone this size the battery seems to last longer then the first one i got because this time i charged the phone up for eight hours and not just pop the battery in it and turn it on some phones if not all you have charged the battery for awhile so you can get the full of it before you just turn it on yes this phone do not have the latest android update on it like android  but it has  it is still a good phone for what you pay for it if you are not that picky,positive

i ordered this blackberry curve g  after my older blackberry  completely died after many wonderful years of service needless to say i am what you call a crackberry addict so you can imagine how happy i was to find a  brand new and for only  needless to say i purchased it immediately it arrived about  days later and the shipping was free i was somewhat skeptical if it was going to be brand new and not just a cleaned up refurbished one but low and behold it came in brand new factory sealed packaging it was brand spanking new the battery was partially charged and only took less than an hour to be fully charged it works great i have no complaints thus far and would definately order from this seller again maybe i can get a great deal on the blackberry passport from them we will see ,positive

there are plenty of reviews about the phone itself so outside of noting that the wife is very happy with her note  im going to comment on the vendor we chose ngpusastorethe phone did not ship from washington it came from kowloon that has  that is no big deal because i love kowloon and the phone was shipped via fedex air so we received it within five daysthe vendor states that the phone is new in the original box and it certainly was one end seal was slit open but the other seal was intact thereby acting like a hinge for the box the packing film was still intact on the front and back of the phone and there was no sign that the accessories had been removed including the battery which was still in its sealed bag the phone box was very well protected in bubble wrap and since the c is nominally intended for europe a usa adapter for the ac charger was included in the shipping box if you have a externally powered usb hub you really do not need the samsung charger to charge the phone for all intents and purposes this phone was new in box in perfect condition and completely unlocked after a quick charge insertion of the xdsc and transfer of the micro sim card from her s the phone came to life was recognized by the carrier and was thus ready for service it was almost like buying a phone in singapore where we purchased her old s and phones must be unlocked by lawwe ordered the c because our research indicated that this phone contains the g bands necessary in the us for either att or t mobile we do not have a data plan with our current carrier pure talk but thought that we should have a fully capable phone should we ever find it practical to switch we rely on our mb wifi at home or free wifi at the airport for data keeping in mind that most of the free public wifi is generally anemic maybe that will improve with time in the meantime data performance of this phone using our robust home wifi is outstandingso not only is the wife very happy with the samsung note  we can heartily endorse this particular vendor ngpusastore,positive
my grand chiid lost his phone this is a replacement if he loses this one its on him and he will have to go to work,positive
yasss i just received this phone a couple days ago im beyond satisfied with my purchase there was a delay with the delivery but the phone is definitely worth the money easy to use and setup its larger than i expected but im getting use to it the screen resolution is great and the camera is awesome and has a photo editer in the gallery that is pretty cool,positive

if you want or need smallthis is it just like its grown ups it is a full functional phone the only real draw back to it it the inability to use the stock keyboard for any practical purposes but after install a big button keyboard app and turning the phone sideways that is even manageable,positive

i was looking for an upgrade phone from my iphone  and wanted to go back to an android phone i use prepaid no contract service by straight talk i wanted a phone that was going to be heavy on my pockets i was searching on amazon for phones when the blu studio phones came up i have never heard of blu studio so i was curious i had read several reviews from customers and was please the majority of the reviews i read were very favorable i decided to buy the blue studio  hd in pink i have had it now for about two weeks and i love it setting up the phone was easy i just popped my slim card in from my iphone and i was up and running i love the large screen great volume excellent picture taking and g speed i have no complaints my  year old daughter was also in the market for a new phone and recommended the blu studio  hd and she loves it she said she could not be happier and we both love the affordable cost we are so glad we did not spend a lot of money on one of the other top cellphones on the market i will definitely buy a another blu studio in the future when im ready four another upgrade again i would like to try the blu windows phones it looks like a good phone,positive

i recently purchased an iphone s plus after having an iphone  for nearly a year and i just did not like ios anymore ive been using iphones since the iphone gs days and ios does not really feel like it has  it is changed i have tried android several times over the years but decided to go  in this time i purchased the nexus x because i liked the smaller footprint and i liked that it came straight from google the phone has been a fantastic upgrade so far the os is snappy the device is well built feels great in the hand and is quite light usbc is great and the fact that it has  it is reversible is the best part when i would use android after using my iphone the biggest thing i missed was the reversible lightning connector the screen looks great as well being very vibrant and bright touch screen responsiveness is also very precise and the nexus imprint sensor is crazy fast i thought the touch id sensor on my s plus was fast but this is even faster i barely have to set my finger on the sensor for the phone to unlock as a whole the phone brings one of the best experiences available to the cell phone market and at a low cost i have no problem recommending this device to anyone in the market for a new phone,positive
the pantech link  is a great looking phone for calls and texting you dont need a data plan but it has many features it has a calender to put appointments into an alarm clock camera and more its a simple phone for people who use it just for texts and calls,positive

well this was a gift to my dad and he loves it he has it for a couple of months now and i just asked him how is the phone and he said it has  it is perfect,positive
cool phone,positive
i bought this phone for my dad he is an old man who just now wanted to deal with electronics time has passed and android has become very easy to use and a smartphone like this lg g mini he has gotten the chance to experiment the world at his hand he knows nearly nothing about computers i have been teaching him and i am surprised about how easy he has learned his way to this devicefrom my point of view as an android user since  this device lacks nothing a high end device has in terms of functionality it is fast smooth easy to play with has nice features of course you do not get a highend camera but it has two it has stereo speakers it delivers excellent sound which is what he likes the bestso for the easiness and features it has i am giving this little lg g mini five well deserved stars it will not compete against the giants but it does compete and wins among its similar competitors samsung could try something like this but they still leave the best for their super expensive devices and the ones that could compare to this one are probably a hundred bucks more expensivemy father is happy with it and so am i,positive
this phone was brand new as advertised and it works like a champ was delivered earlier which made it even better,positive
was exactly as promised,positive
amazing phone arrived on time great product,positive
excellent phone cannot find a better value anywhere else good performance with some of the latest android software and one of the biggest screens in this size segment awesome the g mini can do everything the s mini can do for  less i am very happy with the purchase,positive

great deal quality phone never spend hundreds again,positive
wonderful phone i bought this during presale and it went above and beyond my expectations it is super fast very bright and the battery lasts the entire day the huge screen makes netflix an enjoyable experience on the phone for once and the very thin lightweight body makes holding it comfortable over long periods of timeim giving this phone a  star review because it earned it if you purchase a  phone expecting a camera like the s you are setting yourself up for disappointment obviously the camera on the xl is soso but most people buying a phone in this price range dont want or need a camera like the s iphone or g so that is not an issue to me it still takes great photos and videos heres a suggestion do not purchase this phone if you want slr quality shots its assanine to expect otherwisethe screen is crisp and bright and everything pops and again for  stop expecting ultra high end hardware i cannot imagine anyone truly needing any higher specs than what this offers unless you are realllly into tech stuff play a lot of games i do not play any so i cannot account for the efficiency of the phone in that area or are an actual photographervlogger etc blu is not an innovative company they offer lowmid range phones for cheap and luckily we are in an era where the minimum standards for low end are surprisingly comfortable compared to smartphones threefour years agoive seen people say the body feels like cheap plastic but it feels smooth and luxurious to me i love it you will survive without an exterior made of molten plastic or metal i promise the touch screen is also extremely responsive for me and not at all laggy i think people running into this problem may have gotten a bad batch of phones something blu is notorious for unfortunatelyall in all great phone for anyone,positive
bought this phone for use in the us on att initially there were issues but i was prepared to have some and att helped fix them one issue i still have is that the carrier websites do not recognize the imei  for the phone i had to speak with someone to get the phone working on the network ive also found my att signal is maxing at g no lte with  bars but on average im getting h to h service the one x im switching from had much better signal strength i believe this to be related to band issues and would like to add it was something i was prepared for thus im not letting it effect my review samsungs ui is not too painful just yet and im loving the screen on this thing wifi signal strength is soliddo know when ordering this version you will receive a european charging cable usb works fine but the quick charge plug included will not work here in the us without an adapter,positive
nice phone for the price great for a kids first phone enough gb and good features at a low price,positive
it is really a great phone with great looks and performance i have recommended it to my friends and they have bought it too,positive
i love it so light easy access to charging port  headphones so far so good had it for a few days so much lighter than the otter defender and i like the open ports i have not dropped it but will update if it phone breaks and will post photos a definite  stars as far as being light easy port access and the name otter i trust this was a cheap buy for  i paid  for the defender from the cell phone store im sure it would have been cheaper elsewhere like amazon,positive
i have a simple moble sim card and it does not fit do it has wifi overall i like once i get it to work,positive
so far so good still learning the ins and outs of the phone and all it has to offer,positive
i was so hesitant in buying this phone for several weeks as so many reviews claimed that the g does not work on their tmobile network well to my surprise it does maybe because i live in a big city atlanta and the towers are completed not sureas for the phone i had it for a week and i like it thus far i had a htc before this is my first samsung device i feel like the battery drains a little faster than my htc i had issues with wifi connecting so i googled some of the issues and it works fine now i really like the phone so far just have to get used to the slightly different software buy it you will not be disappointed unless you really want to spend  on those highend phones which i do not see the need for,positive
pink tree cammo would not normally be my first choice in color but an otterbox for  im fine with it it actually matches a camp chair i havei got this for my iphone se and it fits perfectly you cannot use the thumb id feature because there is a rubber plug over the thumb button which i think is there to protect the button from overuse issues  ive encountered overuse of that button on an ipad so i assume there could be problems with the phones too but id rather have the button hold up than the thumb id so that has  that is not a problem,positive
very impressive the quality of the camera and the navigation appa are super,positive

i really love this phone though it was going t be too big but not really that badi had been using s and really liked how i could fit it into a fron pocket but after waiting too long decided to go with this size iphone and try it outbattery life is excellent and the bigger screen is worth carrying around the sizeso here s so helpful information i bought a used one the phone is unlocked as a modela no matter if the person who brought it from verizon leased or bought it out rightthat is just how verizon does it there is only one usa model a i am not sure if a gsm seller such as tmobile just deactivated the cdma capabities or the firmware does not have themso i knew this and bought it to use on tmobile actually this is better that a gsm only phone because you can sell it to anyone once you are done with itthe hotspot feature and wifi calling both work just search wifi calling after you put in your sim card then the first time you use the phone it will ask you to confirm your  address then you just turn it on and off okay now to the great part i took a chance on warehouse deals and it paid offif you look at a phone for sale by awdyou will notice just a condition is given all description as other warehouse dealsthe lowest deal acceptable means this for sure no original box no charger and no earbudsthe good means maybe one of those things is included but not allthe very good means everything but original box and condition must match signs of wear but no dentsnot many marks or scratches and like new means just that looks new with everything originalnow if you go for the lowest condition as i did you can receive a like new looking phone with nothing else or a slightly beat up one with scratches on glassand you can receive any condition in between just no extraswhen i ordered the phone it stated that it would take a while to get it awd does not always have the phone ready just one matching the description from whoever they bought it fromso basically they uses the lowest acceptable  as a hedge against someone complainingthe phone i got was completely like new and they threw in a plastic bag with charger and earbudsand the price was cheaper that any other seller on here by quite a bit alsotake a chance on awd if you are unhappy you can return plus they have the best customer service,positive
great phone,positive

if you are a blackberry preos fan this phone is it it strikes a great balance between touch screen capabilities and physical keyboard the  is absolutely beautiful i do not know how else to describe it it looks like it was designed to the ultimate executive the keyboard is awesome to use ive had a galaxy s galaxy s iphone  and iphone s this year while the  does not have the specs of those phones the blackberry os integrates so well with the phone hardware that you will not notice any lags in performance you are not going to be able to play infinity gauntlet or any of the higherpowered games but chances are you do not really care about that if you are looking at a blackberry  the  is amazing at what it has  it is supposed to do which is a communication device it has  it is not pretentiousif the iphone is the lexus of smartphones and the galaxy s series is the mercedes then i would say blackberry is the audi of smartphones i would recommend this phone to any professional looking for a streamlined device aimed at productivity,positive

the phone works great as advertised the battery last longer than my old galaxy s i am using it for about  month and i had no problem with it i am using it with a straigh talk plan in new york city and the network signal is not all the time full but i asume that is a network problem and is not the phone the internet works on g lte but as i said is not great all the time especially inside the house transportation vehicles,positive
ive had the original moto g for years and love it when the g came out i was reticent because of reviews alleging a heat problem i decided to get a g plus at first i was a bit putoff by the larger size which does not feel as comfortable as the smaller g i also noticed that the unit indeed warms up occasionally when using the camera after awhile i got used to the size and came to really appreciate the larger high rez screen the camera is excellent audio can sound a bit tinny if too loud but that has  that is a minor complaint build quality is excellent overall a great phone,positive
as good as expected,positive
i absolutely love this case it is really cute and it is very protective the clear covering over the screen of the phone seems to be smudge resistant as well i would highly recommend it,positive

i bought this phone used through the amazon warehouse deals i was not expecting much but i figured that if anything was wrong i could simply return itthe box arrived in a few days and im not exaggerating when i say that this phone was just like new it came in its original packaging with all of the accessories and manuals and there were no visible scratches the only thing that let me know that the phone was used was that the port where the charger goes and the speakers had gotten a little dusty so in short the phone arrived in likenew conditionas for the phone itself it has  it is worked fine for me so far ive been using it for about two weeks now and i have not encountered any problems the only complaints i have are about att and their service not the phone itself it bears repeating that if you get this phone it has  it is not unlocked and you are stuck with att if you can make peace with that and one is on offer from warehouse deals i highly recommend getting this phone,positive
i bought the white g version of this phone last week i am extremely happy with my purchase but it is a real pain in the ass to get the sim and straight talk all working together i love this phone better than my galaxy s it has  it is interface is soooooo simple it really is made for human beings it does not come pretethered to facebook or virtually any other apps for that matter but that is nice because u get to pick and choose ur own apps from google play this phone was  cheaper than my galaxy the screen resolution is beautiful no hesitation or lags in videos it looks and feels like a solid wellbuilt phone my brother has the exact same model and he loves his too the camera is high definition and looks wonderful i actually had to turn my brightness down just to save battery it is almost too bright and vibrant just turn the brightness down a litttle bit it saves the battery too with very moderate use after  charges i am able to get two full days out of the battery do yourself a huge favor and buy this phone except for the setup aggrivation it will blow u away also make sure one of ur first downloads is an app killer otherwise the device will run out of memory just keep hitting that app killert everytime u use the phone and u should not ever run out of memory,positive
the color looks beautiful it has  it is an excelent phone it feels very comfortable in your hands very resistant too ive dropped it a few times and just the battery cover is thrown away and a few others the battery pops out but the plastic keeps scratch free not to say that you can drop it without care but when it happens it will not suffer to much unless it falls screen flat on a hard surface and it shall  it will broke ,positive

i like this phone because it is similar to my samsung reality schu which died a sudden death unexpectedly i did not want a data package and after numerous research i almost ruled it out because everything said you had to have a data plan with this phone but one reviewer helped me so much he did not want one either dealing with verizon which can be no pleasant thing can be challenging but you can ask to have the data package dropped and a data block placed on the phonegreat phonehighly recommended,positive

until now the nexus x has fulfilled all my expectations no bloatware and periodic updates from google the charger is very fast and it uses usbc that is reversible very nice smartphone for its price,positive
it was a great phone works just like a samsung phone the camera is good but not as good as a samsung phone it is quick and responsive has not had any problems or glitches the dual sim card comes in handy even if your using two domestic sim cards it is customizable allowing you to use the sim cards as you wish like if you have unlimited data but limited minutes and text on one sim card and the other with unlimited minutes and text but no data it would allow you to use the minutes and text with the second while only using the first sim card for data with out wasting you minutes and text from that sim card it has excellent battery life with decent brightness i would not mind trying another huawei product maybe one that is better than the p lite,positive
just as described fast shipping thank you,positive

it has totally exceeded if you could love a phone id be totally head over heelsid read the reviews and it was considered a mediocre smartphone it has  it is fast has all my favourite apps on it and has room and speed to spare i had a galaxy  best damn phone ever but it died this replaces it and i think it has  it is a bit better i like the big screen how clear it is inside or outside the camera is good and sharp but not professional grade it has duel sim cards slots if you need that i would say the only drawback is the lack of aftermarket cell covers it comes with one but id really like to have my tardis cover,positive
after a year still works in perfect condition,positive
very happy with the phone brand new and everything came with it,positive
this is a great inexpensive phone other reviewers complain of things that are missing and ill agree that a flash for the camera a rear facing camera and a larger internal sd card would be great however for the money i cannot see beating this date july ,positive

i recently received two of these cell phones from amazon and i must say i am quite impressed they came unlocked and their appearance and quality is amazing right out of the box the batteries were fully charged and ready to go it took a few hours to read and apply the manual with backup from utube videos after i familiarized myself with the phone i inserted our smart cards and we were on the internet and texting i got this phone to compliment a no contract family plan from the carrier pure talk with the  plan the phones have been crystal clear and the texting is quite easy no need for the smart phone this fits the bill for us older adults who use the phone for necessities great job nokia,positive

excellent its the best smartphone ever if i have to do it again i would not have any doubts samsung and android are the greatest,positive
this phone has so many great features but most impressive is the camera with the free windows  update installed cortana is great and this phone is much more useful than an iphone despite people bemoaning the lack of a specific app here and there i was able to find all of the apps i wanted for the phone in the store with one exception for that internet explorer worked fine accessing the same functionality via the web i also found the battery life to be exceptional and lasting for  hours gps navigation will suck the battery like it did on the  before it but unlike the  i was surprised that this model did not have builtin inductive charging i do not like having a  case on the phone so ive opted to plug it in this is my only disappointment with this model but windows phone has come a long way and is equal to or better than other phone operating systems i loved using this with xbox ones smartglass application and cortana is actually helpful aside from the standard witty responses since there has  there is no inductive charging this only gets an a rating,positive

bought this phone as i was switching carriers and my sprint samsung galaxy s was not compatible with tmobile let me first say that you get g lte wo any problem on tmobile i went into my nearby store and they configured the setting in less than a minute i am not sure why so many people complained about this phone not working with the tmobile networki actually like this phone better than my s it has a much nicer design i cant tell the difference in screen quality between the p alpha and p s this is likely due to the fact that we are dealing with screens around  inches and not big screen tvs as far as battery life is concerned i only notice a drain if the screen brightness is set high which is an issue on any phonei highly recommend this phone to anyone now that the price is under  the specs you get for the price are pretty impressive i also like the fact that the screen is not   inches which is becoming standard these days,positive
bought it as a present and my father loves it,positive
this was what i have expected from the a smart phone i have no problems with itan awesome phone,positive
excellent price quality relationship,positive
it has  it is a nice phone like it a lot will get  more for relatives,positive

my only gripe the s beautiful wide screen can crack easily if it falls on one of its corners otherwise this is an impressive phone with an exceptional camera windows  takes some getting used to but it has  it is actually quite refreshing after having used apple ive never used android the app store is not the biggest but it has most of the best known applications out there some of nokias apps are exceptional too including the filters for photos the gps here drive is functional but drains the battery fast use your charger while operating the phone is elegant too a welldesigned pocket computer and it has  it is free from verizon with a contract,positive
gifted this to my  yr old nephew and he really likes using it it is impressive and real value for money,positive
just what i was looking for came one day later than expected due to a holiday though ,positive
everything good,positive
i saw some bad reviews but i have to say this phone is perfect i got if for the kids as i did not want to sign another  years contract or use my edge bucks on a phone it is windows based and has a little getting use to but for calling texting and standard social networking this thing is a breeze the only issue i had was it was missing a sim card that is solved two ways first when i call support they said just go the verizon store and say your sim card was damaged and they will give you one for free worked perfect the other way is to order one from amazon and after the fact i noticed it was not to expensive good luck,positive
phone was in the original packaging and works great,positive
love this phone it has even upheld to my sons abuse the cases we found to cover them are so c ute to,positive
excellent product just what i was looking for,positive
very simple phone but works for me,positive
love the battery life,positive

i have read the other reviews of this phone at this time i have only had the phone a few weeks but am much happier than some other reviewers i bought it because it came in a case and is water proof maybe more water resistant while i have no need for an apple phone i wanted a smart phone preferably at a good price this phone went on vacation and worked admirably as i repaired electric circuits and an automobile for my daughter it kept me from getting lost in the darklight or unfamiliar citiesgps i was able to keep up with personal business when my vacation was extended in short it did all i expected and asked plus a bit more we will see how durable it is im just the guy to bang it up in the woods here in the midwest,positive

probably one of the best cellphone ever used even it has  it is over a year old still performs on par with new phones that came out now holds a very good battery life although these days with pokemon go no phone can hold it has  it is battery but before that can go  days without charging on a regular use definitely last through a whole dayscreen is big enough phone feels very classy water proof definitely a plus even as sony release the x performance i would still use this other than the camera there are no real performance upgrade from the zp to the xp,positive

lg has always made a quality phones this phone is no different and their hardware is top of the line feel and look is of a high end phone and specs are all top notch phone is really fast and i was able to buy brand new on sale for  for that price it beat all other phones for similar specs only thing i do not like about lg phones is that they really do not care about upgrading your firmware after they sell the phone which is a shame because their phones are really capable of great things for the same price this phone would be a much better choice than motorola moto g or even blu life pure mini i own both,positive
very good phone it has  it is an international version with adapter,positive

i had a bb z and loved it it was very durable but finally had to be replaced after i accidentally took it swimming it still works but the internal speaker was adversely affected so i went out on amazon looking for a new blackberrythe z i purchased has everything i was used to on my z and a little more it has  it is a little bigger a little faster and the battery lasts longerthe only knock ive seen so far is the battery is sealed as opposed to the z on which i could swap batteries ill just have to watch my power levels closer and make sure i plug it in when i can,positive
bought this for my son he loves it,positive
the  stars is not because this is the best phone ever i do however feel it was the best deal for the money from the little time i have had the phone i do notice the battery once in use goes quickly but for my needs no real issue as i mainly text was concerned about problems using a tracfone sim card and the number transfer took a long time but again no hiccupsthe phone is clear runs apps better than my old lg hooking my wife up with same right now as early christmas present very impressed so far,positive
love this phone great quality brand new and it arrived earlier than expected,positive
htc hit it out of the park with this one ive never been a fan of their phones in the past because of reliability issues and their sense software was pretty bad this phone is incredible build is wonderful no case for about  months and it does not have a scratch design is beautiful screen is gorgeous camera is hit or miss it takes some truly beautiful photos sometimes other times they are awful i like the idea of the ultrapixel camera but the technology has a ways to go i love the wide angle lenses you can capture quite a bit in a shot the camera software is the best ive used adds a lot of useful features without making it complicated on the software side sense  is hands down the best version of android available i even prefer it to stock android that comes on nexus devices adds a ton of utility while keeping it simple and fastsmooth as anything the snapdragon  inside is more than enough to handle anything you throw at it by far one of the fastest phones ive used with the exception of the nexus  i did not mention the speakers they are everything their reputation suggests highest quality audio ive ever heard out of a phone could be a smidge louder but i really cannot complain since they are already louder than about everything out there also the fact that they face forward makes so much sense battery life is good as long as power saver is on it has  it is just okay without it i only have  complaints  is the button setup it has  it is awful  capacitive keys does not make any sense there are currently  actions bound to my home key tap double tap hold and swipe up no logic in that the other is the preinstalled att garbage there are like  apps that you cannot uninstall most can be disabled but really i wont use pay to use att navigation over free google maps there are tons like that and they add more with every update i hate it not really a fault with the phone but the carrierto sum it up i will be an htc customer for a long time if you are on the line buy this phone you will not regret it,positive
phone was in great condition and arrived promptlythat has  that is all it takes for me to be happy,positive
just what i ordered works perfectly,positive
i love the small size of this phone the general trend is to phones much larger than what i want,positive
i have only had this phone for roughly a week so i cannot yet attest to its durability however i see some reviews below stating that this phone is not g compatible this is not true i use a tmobile prepaid sim card and always get a g signal when i have mobile data enabledthe screen is huge but very visually pleasing sound quality is good and android  is pretty easy to get the hang ofim super impressed with the battery life i try to conserve battery life through the proper settings but with past phones still needed to throw my phone on the charger after work with this phone i have been able to make this last until bedtimei will update this review after ive had the phone for a little while,positive
great phone for my daughter in jamaica only negative is that it does not read flow or digicellocal carriers sim cards i will have to unlock this phone that sucks i was thinking it is unlocked to any gsm carrier but it is only to us network sim cards i tried a metro pcs sim in it in jamaica and it read it,positive
otter box makes one of the best phone protectors ive never had a phone crack or break in an otterbox the rubbery grip makes it easy to hang onto bright colors are fashionablethe only shortcoming is that it offers zero moisture protection there has  there is something about it that almost draws an errant drop of liquid into the case,positive
very happy so far excellent battery life and seems very fast compared to the rugby pro that it replaced,positive
i have bought hundreds of stuff on amazon but this is the first thing that has motivated me to leave a review i cannot possibly recommend this phone enough it has everything you need and delivers as an identical performance as the s or iphone plus it has gb storage out from the box the sound quality will blow you off the screen is so beautiful gb of ram is enough to use every app you want and to multitask all of this for a fraction of the price of an s or iphone this is truly the flagship killer and i do not think not even the one plus  matches get this phone,positive
got this to use with straight talk works perfectly while not the most powerful phone out there if you are like me all that extra processing power would be wasted after the initial tinkering unless you are really into cutting edge d gaming on your phone this little guy will not disappoint,positive
the phone is great got what i expected,positive
perfect fit for our s and the price is amazing,positive
very fast processor would recommend,positive

product was as described would recommend this buyer to others,positive
he absolutely loves this phone an it was more than worth the money spent on it,positive
an amazing phone if you are in the us be prepared to run into small workable issues i use att and the company was great in supporting the unlocked phone setting me up with a visit to the distribution office for the nanosim install and activation the issues i am talking about is the distribution centers have no experience with this phone and had no idea how to move the data from my old samsung rugby smart phone version to the new phone how to install the nano sim or the sd card since att will not allow two phones to be active at the same time i could not download the xperia app to the old phone  you must do this prior to deactivating the old sim  via google play a similar app is needed for bluetooth transfer  the only option to find and buy the xperia data cable and try that for those reading this and are thinking that all i have to do is to remove the sd card from the old samsung rugby which is also an android device with all the latest updates it doesnt work the xperia z compact rejected the phone contacts as not being in the right format what the heck the samsung rugby smart phone version does not use the vcf format and will not transfer to the xperiaeven if i have to transfer all my contacts to my new xperia z compact manually im willing to do so this phone supports amazingly clear conversations using bluetooth headset speakerphone or near the face the camera is outstanding even though there are complaints of the  display i dont see it i am very happy with a phone that is not tethered to a charging dock every few hours i have to ask if wireless means you are not connected to an rj jack but are tethered to a charger all the time what is the difference bonus with the reasonable screen size i do not have to hire a porter and baggage cart to haul it around it fits into my pocket imagine that,positive
all good thanks,positive
much faster than s,positive
i ordered this for my wife who wanted a full keyboard on her phone as opposed to the virtual keyboard i have on my iphone i read the stellar reviews and frankly they are all accurate the device is absolutely beautiful to look at and amazingly compact setup is super easy just pop in your sim card and follow the wizard commands i had email set up with aol the internet working on g and wifi and all my wifes contacts copied off the sim card in under  minutes i am not kidding make sure you have a basic unlimitted data plan on board the operating system symbian is superb and is a cross between windows functionality and a the ease of a palm based system i still love my iphone but this thing does stuff video phone for example that the iphone does not do it is absolutely superior to the blackberry bold and the high end samsung devices nokia has a real winner and i can see why this phone is so popular overseas,positive
it was great,positive
i was so skeptical to buy a used phone off here but i love it so much not a scratch on it and works perfect do not buy from anyone else saved so much money and im very satisfied,positive

this is a great phone i love the size but it is not for everyone it has a great accurate compass gps works great and it supports otg i have no problems connecting a thumb drive using a otg cable i use it on straight talk and never had a problem with service i also have the flirone camera that works great on this phone but the usb port is offset to the side making it a bit awkward but it does work fine i was able to download the lollipop firmware from huaweis website and had no problems upgrading the os but that is the only update i was able to find no updates since the only problem with this size phone is trying to fit it into a vr headset it is simply too big despite the vr headsets specifying this size phone would fit but this is certainly not the fault of this great phonedisclaimer i did not receive this item at a discounted rate i paid the full going price at the time of purchase and my review was not influenced in anyway feel i should make this disclaimer these days,positive
excellent excellent excellent cannot believe this amazing phone really love it working so smoothly and incredibly fast even the case is plastic it looks very nice and especially this k screen wow so nice i recommend this phone to windows fans and who is tired of iphone and android,positive

ive had the cookie for about a month now and i am so happy with my purchaseit was fully charged when i received it and all the mentioned items were in the box including the charger with adaptor i slipped my sim card in i have tmobile even more service and it immediately recognized tmobile as the carrier even shows it onscreenspent approximately  minutes playing around with the settings as they are organized a bit differently from us phonesfor instance the settings for ring tones are under the settingsprofilenormal names not the usual ones we see here however it has  it is pretty easy and the touchpad appears to become more responsive with time as you get used to itthe qwerty keyboard is great and the accelerometer function works quite well for typing with either small fingers or the stylus people have received my texts promptly as i have theirs anyone considering this phone would do well to check the services their provider offers  if you do not have an internet plan well the phone will not surf the net  i say this because ive seen a couple of complaints about that issue i do not use my phone for that purpose just calls and texting and it has  it is perfectly suited for such also this is not a wifi or g equipped phone which again suits my needs but perhaps not othersthey shall  they will have to spend a bit more for that and sacrifice battery life speaking of battery life i am a fairly heavy talker and only charge my phone every  days  and it charges in less than a couple hoursall in all if you are patient and like to fiddle with new gadgets as i do you will love this phone the wallpapers ringtones and games are really great and again im extremely happy with my little christmas present to myself,positive

my son love it thanks,positive
good phone has a wonderful battery life on it,positive
i needed the international version for compatibility because im from costa rica now that the phone is not so overpriced here in amazon it was a great option for me to buy it herethe dash charge system is ridiculously fast the phone processing capacity is great im a mobile gamer the gb ram is a wonderful feature the screen is really nice and both front and rear camera perform greatly oxygen os is efficient but not very customizable principally in terms of the visual aspects what i like is that in comparison to samsungs android version it does not have all that bloatware so the gb of disk space are actually for your stuff and not for a bunch of useless apps you did not ask for all the problems i had read there were with this phone ram management battery use battery temperature etc seem to have been solved with the different os updatessimply great,positive
received in great condition and shape,positive
great phone and works wellall of the positive things said by others i agree with however there is one slightly misleading item about the dualsim and gb sd cardyou can use two sim cards or you can use one sim card and an sd cardyou cannot use two sims and an sd cardother than that the phone is great,positive
tldr this is a good phone for people that like the windows os especially at the current pricei got into windows phones about  years ago after having the nexus  and nexus  android phones ive used some budget windows phones from nokia and decided to give the  a try a few months ago since it was being offered at a big discount to retail on amazon i liked windows because i do not use a lot of apps  usually will do it and all the ones i do use are on the platform  if you are an app for everything person then windows phones are likely not for you the windows  os makes significant improvements over the previous os and it feels like a well integrated intelligent system to use the build quality is at least equal to the nexus phones and a step up from other lumias ive used overall if you like windows this is a terrific phone,positive
great phone,positive
excellent it could not be better,positive

i got this iphone refurbished a couple weeks ago it took forever for it to arrive but i do not think that was the sellers fault just simply the fact i had ordered this during the holiday season my previous phone was an iphone s and was stolen i was very pleased with this phone and could see that it operates much better than the s as the seller described the outer casing was slightly scuffed but the phone itself operates perfectly i did not mind the minor scratches since i put a case on the phone anyway it was a great purchase,positive

ive been looking for a while for a small phone with good specs this is exactly what i was looking for there are zero other options if you want a phone this small with decent specs storage and android marshmallow i have big hands but the interface is smooth and easy to use it is not a small screen  it has  it is what would have been considered a normal sized screen five years ago it has  it is solid feeling gets good signal strength compared to my wifes iphone has a good battery life with moderate use and no daytime charging i usually have  battery at the end of the day the speakers sound decent when listening to music not superb but much better than a lot of other phones and tablets ive used very usable for watching shows or movies using the built in speakershigh temperatures fixed when it came in the mail it had lollipop installed after the setup process it felt quite hot however i then immediately did the overtheair software upgrades there were three updates in a row the first an upgrade to marshmallow and then two more incremental upgrades  bug fixes after those upgrades it has never gotten hot again a little warm but comparable to any other phone ive ever usedyou can uninstall or disable most of the sony bloatware pretty easily with the only exception being this what has  what is up app that was telling me about random celebrity birthdays and crap like that in the notifications i got it to shut up and go away by disabling its data privilegesthe camera is amazing there is a builtin camera button which i love it has a twolevel press like a real camera soft press to focus and hard press to snap photos i wish the lens was not right on the corner though  im always sticking my finger in front of it by accidentmy primary complaint is that i wish there was a hardware button bar at the bottom so that the buttons back home etc did not take up screen real estate i guess that has  that is a minor complaint though im getting used to it and they hide during videos or gamingnote if you want to use otg devices it is not automatic you have pull down and hit a button to attach otg stuff a little annoying but if you are plugging in wired stuff to the mirco usb plug you are not really expecting fast convenience anyway,positive
very nice cell phone,positive
only problem im having is running outta of data space me sad ,positive
purchased from breed and honestly the phone looks brand new just a little scratch in the one of the corners but looks pretty new was extremely skeptical about purchasing it because i heard a lot of criticism about it still being locked to verizon after reading a few comments indicated to change the apn it worked works and looks like brand new,positive
this phone has everything i need it has a powerful  mp camera that any phone could envy i almost think sometimes that it will take xrays instead of pictures because of the balancing provided by its sensors the quantum display shows its very fine quality on every picture or video the phone practically functions with all the service providers worldwide my problems with installing apks have finished thanks to its big  gb the lggusgb i only would like that in this spectacular phone the fm radio works but is not the fact im still delighted with it when the perfect phone appears i will hate mine but until then i still love it,positive
this is a great phone and worth every penny if not more it is fast has great sound and the screen is amazing the best thing about it the is the battery life i can use for at least  days more depending light use without having to charge it my family has used both of the two top smart phones but we all have slowly turned to blu because of the quialty and price,positive
works very well no trouble,positive

great phone i just could not get past my love of the iphone and adjust to android the camera on this phone does some amazing things,positive
this works perfectly for all purposes it is just like brand new i was prepared for there to be a downside somewhere and still have it worth the money i was pleasantly surprised when it outperformed my expectations my kid worked all month to earn the money for this phone and is thrilled we have had several fives and a couple sixes in the family phone collection and this one was just as swanky as any mint iphone,positive

i ordered  phones from themone used one refurbished they came pretty fast  days thumbs up for that phones are as described used one is in decent condition refurbished is like new did not manage to test them but im sure they are ok,positive
ive had this phone for  weeks now and have to say that ive had zero issues and it has  it is a fantastic value ive never owned an unlocked phone but activating it was simple and painless i chose to go with att for now my son has had a basic blu phone that was bought last year and at the time i was very hesitant about the company strictly because of the price in my mind you get what you pay for so i was under the impression that blu phones were very basic and had some flaws to them in some way in my experience this phone is top notch and all of my coworkers that have an iphone are a bit jealous,positive
i love this phone very fast and great screen size super responsive makes my old s seem like a model a,positive
i am really happy i made the decision to not buy an en expensive phone like galaxy note  from samsung when this phone feels just as goodbefore i bought the phone i was afraid that the screen resolution was a bit small but the screen it self has really good colors it has  it is super bright and i do not even notice the low resolutionthe battery life is just amazing i have never ran out of power and if i go low i just simply turn of features like bluetooth gps and brightness and the phone can go for hours on  even with use of g networkthe phone is big and a bit heavy it has  it is basically impossible to use it with one hand even though they have induced settings for making the interface more onehand friendlyone thing that i was a bit disappointed by but is not enough to loose a star for is the back camera it is really bad in low light and has a long response time for me it seems like the front camera with the wide angle lens is better good news for selfie peoplewith this phone ive gotten comments on the size and look on a daily basis it has  it is way bigger than what i anticipated it to be a bit shocked when i opened the box but now im pretty sure i can never go back to a smaller phone great for whatching movies or tv shows on and easy to share content with other people due to the super bright  screeni highly recommend this phone to everyone that wants a big phone that looks and feels greatthere is no reason to overpay for a phone from samsung lg apple or other big brands when you can get something just as good for this price ,positive
like this cell very much love its customization features,positive

overall i like the size and quality of the phone,positive
great company to do business with love my iphone,positive
let me start by saying that this phone is phenomenal price to value ratio is excellent beautiful screen snappy performance with excellent audio quality very very impressive we need more phones like these in the us market to compete with the big boys as i am tired of paying  for a phone honestly this phone should be the flagship killer instead of oneplus screen gorilla glass  screen with a resolution of xit is extremely bright with vivid colors this screen is pleasure to look atanother thing about this beautiful display is that there is some type of coating that prevents finger prints and i love it every phone in the market should be like axonperformancewhat can i say gb ram paired up with snapdragon  everything is fluid multi tasking is a breeze the only thing i realized is that geekbench was showing the cpu speed as ghz instead of the advertised ghz i am not sure if this is a fluke or geekbench needs to be updated to support the latest cpusaudiowell well well what do we here hifi sound was one of the main features that really made me try this phone and i am glad i did i have a pair of shure s and they sound beautiful with this phone loud very crisp and extremely detailed when compared to other phones such as galaxy s nexus  and oneplus  bravo zte you guys knocked it out of the parkunfortunately external speakers do not live up to its name there is only one speaker and in my opinion it is the weakest part of this phone speakers can be loud however do not expect boom sound qualitycamerai didnt use the camera enough to write an educated review however it captures pictures very quick unlike oneplus  which takes forever to snap a picturebottomlinezte axon offers an exceptional value bundled in a metal unibody for  with jbl headphones this phone is a steal it feels very premium in hand and its mah battery is large enough to get anyone through an entire day zte axon is one of the greatest phones i have ever used including oneplus zte blows oneplus out of water by offering an excellent build quality longer warranty beautiful qhd display and amazing hifi chip,positive
great phone and a great value i recently switched from ios and havnt looked back i really prefer android and a google branded handset makes sense i do wish the phone was smaller though i do not have large hands and one handed operation can be awkward,positive
overall this is a pretty good phone downside is only like gb of free space but other than that is good it looks like a  phone,positive
i just love it and the price was great too,positive
exactly as described works great thank you for expediting shipping for me,positive

product arrived on time and it was just as expected,positive
toughest phone solid features sharp as a knife beautiful camera quality and a fraction of the price of the big names on my second one and only because i dropped the first in a gutter of water in february and it kept chugging until august with the only defect from that drop being no one could hear me speak on the phone itself i had to have on a bluetooth for them to hear me but considering other phones would have been totally unusable or glitching madly after that that is amazing i tried to buy a temporary blue studio phone and the camer sucked was chunky whereas this is large and slim profile without being flimsy comes with a protective case which i find thoughtful love love love this phone and it has  it is dual sim so people like me who are from outside the country and travel to one or two certain ones very often do not have to lose contact with home based folks when gone and do not have to keep track of who has the foreign number or not it has  it is great stuff,positive
phone worked perfectly and still is after several months,positive
great phone fast smoth convenient size,positive
woooow  thank you very much the product arrived super good excellent and ahead of schedule,positive
it was between this and the oneplus three my oneplus one was the best phone i had ever owned so i was eager but the proprietary nature of dashcharge struck me sideways i already own a bunch of qc chargers and i had heard good things about zte and this phoneit is running very close to knocking the opo off and replacing it as my favorite phonea list of pros and conspros price beautifully designed never thought i would love a gold phone this much feels great and balanced in the hand remarkable screen you can  percent tell when watching videos or reading super fast plenty of storage and expandable camera is snappy and takes great pictures in great and okay light fingerprint reader is zippy front facing speakers will blow you away rotating lock screen pictures is a nice touch battery is very capable of getting you through the day fast charging is duh fast loads of extra perks in the box case screen protector usb ctomicrousb adapter and two year total damage warranty with small deductible bootloader can be unlockedcons zte made nonsensical changes to android when skinning it why get rid of notification features lock screen notification bell is an unnecessary step camera can suffer in low light fingerprint sensor location can necessitate multiple tries at time unlocking bootloader voids warranty not sure if it voids passport  warranty toofor me these cons can be easily negated use google now launcher shoot in good light or are not  am not really any deal breakersan almost entirely compromise free smartphone purchase cannot more highly recommend,positive

i recommend the phone to be economic has similar characteristics to any other phone quality or recognized brand dual sim work well with the operator movistar venezuela i immediately recognized good internal memory capacity  excellent rear  megapixel camera with focus and camera  megapixel front  good applications including phone speed is incredible fantastic for that included screen protector and silicon casing for protection besides other accessories to include any other team the incomveniente unique is that it takes a while to load the battery completely and in some occasions where it heats the rear camera but perfect rest,positive

the juning phone i got was a  dual sim phone unlocked ggsm android  quad core color  goldthe functionality of the phone is very similar to any android phones but this one is very affordable and unlockedthe phone comes withcharger usbportearphonesusers manualclear phone casea piece of paper with the note in order to use the batteryremove the yellow filmattached to the screen alreadythe screen protectionscratch protection a thin sheetlike any other phones you got to test the functionality of it and i find it very easy to navigate it has the default apps that we commonly use like facebook wechat whatsapp ect i added facebook messenger youtube google chrome web browser and even added netflixcamera which we mostly use to capture the moments and share it to our family and friends i have no complain it captures very clearlybattery wise i fully charged it the first time and i watched one full movie for like  hours and it has still a little half of the battery i was able to explore some of the features check emails and do some social networkingbut you got to read the label or the note that comes with it because there is a little film that you need to remove in order for you to use the batterysize and weight i think it is the perfect size of the screen for me and not heavy at all to carry around the gold color is a plus it looks so sophisticated and sleekif you wanna do some screenshots just press the button volume down and power button together because it is g you do not expect it to be as fast and quick as gi connected it to my wifi and and connects pretty wellover all impression for this price of an unlocked android phone is pretty good if you go overseas and you need a phone that is unlocked and you can just plug in a prepaid sim card this is a perfect solution and highly recommend this you do not have to carry your phone that will charge you enormously when you use it overseasi tried my tmobile sim and it works wellgot this phone in a discounted price for an honest review based on my experience while using it and to help others who are looking for affordable and unlocked phones that works like any android phones that are expensive,positive
i was a bit apprehensive ordering this phone over amazon i normally buy all of my cell phones through my cell phone carrier but i read such great reviews ordering through amazon i thought i would give it a try i already order weekly from amazon but never a cell phone i ordered this cell phone and it came just as described in new condition brand new box with most importantly unlocked i simply took my old cell phone and this new cell phone to my carrier att and the sales agent transferred all of information from my old phone to my new phone it took only about  minutes for her to do this it was that simple i saved about  ordering the cell phone over amazon than walking into the actual at t store and buying it outright i am very pleased with my purchase i love the samsung galaxy s it is slim and lightweight and lightening fast and what i absolutely love is the super power charger that came with it i had no idea that this little charger would charge my phone in  minutes i cannot say enough good things about this purchase i will order another online great experience not problems at all very satisfied customer,positive
this is my fifth smart phone and the best the last phone i had sucked and the one before it was not much better this one is great i have had it about  weeks and i have not had one malfunction i have not even had to reboot it the lg phone that this replaced would reboot  or  times a day on its own and i would have to reboot  or  times a day when it would lock up,positive
loves to buy electronics on amazon works excelent best price excelent quality and not problems to use in my home costa rica i am so proud to be customer in amazon,positive
this is a great phone the size of it will take some getting used to since it is on the larger side of the spectrum after a month or two though ive grown accustomed and now other phones just seem small to methe front facing camera is a true joy and im the only one i know who has bought it so far that has  that is a plus for me since i hate to have the same as everyone else the only thing preventing me from giving it a  star review is that the sound is not as impressive as i was expecting it to be but maybe my expectations were a little too lofty it does still sound better than my previous phone though also the small size of the side bezel also makes accidental touching of the screen while holding a bother too but these are all minor issues i noticed recently however that my headphone jack stopped working i thought the headphones were the problem but it has  it is definitely the port im not sure why maybe it was due to something on my part but the phone never dropped or anything so im not sure what it could have beenupdateturns out that the headphones were the problem and the phone remains in proper working order misdiagnosis on my part,positive
go ahead keep walking around with your large iphones and becoming ever more dependent on that device ive had a nokia  for almost a decade when the charger post began to malfunction i discovered that it was still available on amazon a sturdy welldesigned little phone with picture texting and email capabilities i added extra memory and it has  it is a very convenient and simple piece of technology that keeps me connected without the need to get obsessive about it i only wish the pictures had more pixels but over the years ive taken some great shots with it if only they could have redesigned the charging post after several years of pulling out the charger the connection could fail again but hey none of the highpriced and oversized iphones are perfect either if you find one of these classics buy it,positive
the best phone l have purchased l love it,positive
so far as my first cell phone i am impressed with it but i am still learning how to use it one thing however it does seem to discharge the battery when it is on for extended periods of time this may very well be normal as i am an inexperienced user,positive
i recently decided to finally enter the st century and get a smartphone my first choice was an android phone that was slow and not user friendly at all meanwhile i visited two friends who each had iphones and were getting along famously i knew what i needed to doi picked up this refurbished one from breed it has  it is in perfect condition it came with only the charging cord which was expected and im fine with that i did make the mistake of neglecting to get a nano sim card see im home all the time and i only wanted to use it for various apps like for a fitbit and texting while at home plus the pictures and video features i got my own free phone number through google play and can text through hangouts all without a plan so i did not think id need a simi learned quickly that a sim is needed to get to the home screen on an iphone so make sure you do that i picked up a tmobile card that had no contract i popped it in and i was good to gothis works beautifully i feel so spoiled now especially after using an inferior phone i highly recommend picking one up from breed especially they did a great job with refurbishing this phone,positive
i love this phone of all the high tech phones out there i love this one it last a very long time after much abuse the battery life id excellent and the phone overall is a good phone,positive
incredible performance for price on par with phones costing s more use it everyday for work emails photo docs scanning emailing docs back to office just a beast a workhorse octacore performance never lets me down no overheating call quality  sound awesome for price point was looking at s also at the time but decided to save my money  go with zte im completely satisfied,positive

i bought this phone to replace my blu life play  which was only a year old i really liked that phone but unfortunately it died after getting wet while riding my motorcycle in the rain in spite of the fact that i had it inside my riding suit i cannot blame the phone for that though anyway this phone is much better than the life play  in every respect it has a newer version of android is more powerful has a bigger sharper screen is thinner runs cooler the battery lasts longer and it has  it is been bugfree for me so far plus it cost almost  less than the life play  the size of the phone is just about as big as id want to get before it becomes unwieldy it sits well in the hand fits in the phone pockets of most of my bags and of course in regular jacket and coat pockets and my riding suit the sound from the phone has been good and clear but the ringtones do have a little bit of an overdrive or distortiontype of sound to them compared to my life play  it has  it is a minor thing and does not affect the usability of the phone in any way one thing to keep in mind when picking a color is that they are painted an extremely vibrant almost dayglo color i picked orange for mine and it has  it is like a safety orange color which was much much brighter than i expected the translucent orange silicone skin that comes with the phone mutes the color down a little but it has  it is still quite vibrant ive attached photos comparing the life play  pink vs the studio c super camera,positive
great item at a reasonable price great delivery great source i would recommend and or purchase items again,positive

okay so first of all i emailed the seller and asked if there was any way he had  he would be able to get my order to me quicker and he did just that secondly the phone came ready to use it came about half way charged all i needed to do was turn it on also the phone came as described used but like new there were a few scuffs on the top but no scratches or cracks that were not previously mentioned from the seller finally all i did was put my sim card in tmobile and the phone was working right away i did not have to call my phone company and this phone set up in any way great seller and great product,positive
phone works fine,positive

this phone has blown away my expectations in a world full of phablets and cell phones that seem to just be getting larger and larger and more and more expensive as well it has  it is becoming seemingly harder and harder to find a small phone that will actually perform this phone does just that and does it wellinitially i had owned an lg g i thought about it and realized man this is insane that i am spending  on a cell phone i decided to return the lg g and give the alcatel idol   a try while i loved the phone it was still larger than i was hoping and the  had not yet been released then one day i checked amazon and the  was out so i made the exchange and i could not be happierpeople may complain about the specs when compared to some current flagship phones are they as good no but heres the thing just a year and a half ago or so if you saw the specs on this phone they would have blown you away think about the flagship phones from a year or two ago were they bad slow etc no they were top of the line this phone has the same specs if not better that those phones had that being said i have not experienced a single hiccup with this phone yet no lag when switching screens or apps no delay in taking pictures no freezing or apps crashing so ask yourself do i really need a phone with specs that the  phones are offeringprosscreen  it has  it is beautiful is it p no and it does not need to be at  p is gorgeous and looks just as nice as my lg g did know what is awesome about the screen being p battery life the lower resolution will greatly improve battery lifesound  the jbl front facing stereo speakers are magnificent the sound is very loud and very clear watching music videos listening to music and even the alarm are all very impressive with the volume and clarity the jbl headphones that come with the phone also have excellent sound and come with different size earbuds to ensure a good fitspeed  it has  it is fast there has  there is no lag when switching apps browsing the web multitasking sending emails etc one review i read elsewhere of the phone stated that when typing the phone would sometimes lag and have to catch up to his typing i am a very fast typer and i have yet to experience this so ymmvsize  perfect everything can be done with one hand it fits well in your palm very thincamera  mp rear and mp front both take excellent photos most importantly to me they both take photos quickly i have a one year old and having to wait  seconds after pressing the capture button will often times make me miss the shot or have them end up blurry the idol  takes it almost instantly  of the timebattery life  very impressed having the slower processor and the lower resolution screen both help to improve the battery life greatly i have been using the phone pretty much non stop since getting it i am a heavy texter social media user and i use the music player with both a bluetooth speaker and a bluetooth stereo headset for  hours a day i have been setting the phone up and redownloading all the apps on my previous phones so i have been on it constantly end of the day it still has plenty of charge left to it i imagine the average user will have no problem getting through a day and a heavy user may be able to as wellcost  cannot be beat obviously  for this phone is an absolute stealconsbrand  not because alcatel is bad but because it is not popular this means little rd party support for accessories and whatnot currently the only tempered glass screen protector available on amazon is by mr shield and the fitment is very poor there are not a lot of cases available at this time hopefully this will change as more people realize what a gem this phone is and actually start buying itoverall this phone is amazing and well worth your money i cannot imagine what you would be doing that requires a phone that costs  more than this phone honestly the size is perfect it has  it is fast the sound is incredible and the battery life has been awesome alcatel has a real winner in this phone the only competition i see at this price point would be the new moto g however i love the form factor and design of the alcatel,positive
happy with my purchase,positive
so far i love this phone i previously had the lg env  and wanted to update to a better phone on verizon without having to get a smartphone with a data plan but verizons website only had  qwerty basic phones to choose from so this phone looked like a much better option at first i was worried because the verizon website would not let me activate it without a mandatory data plan of an additional  a month but after calling and talking to an actual verizon rep they said it should not need a data plan since it is definitely not a smart phone so the rep was able to bypass that little problem for me quite easily problem solved also the phone arrived pretty fast about  days and the condition is great and the battery seems to be holding a full charge perfectly,positive

the phone is in fact new and it arrived pretty quickly i really recommend it a note was sent along with my phone i would most definitely buy from them again,positive
i carry my professional references books in the phone so i have them handy during work the big screen makes it very easy to read it has  it is not a phone that would fit in your pocket it takes good quality pictures and the focus is even better than a regular camera for closeup pictures one downside is that the battery is barely enough for one day of use so you should keep a charger handy,positive

one of three phones i bought this month from amazon thirdparty because of drowned phones this was one was as described or better shipping was very fast very satisfied so far,positive
so far a great phone i did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range i listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the idol  for me was the front facing stereo speakersive had the phone for a few days now and im very impressed with it the user interface is pretty much stock lollipop which i really appreciate there is very little bloatwareshovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed the camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions bluetooth paired up with all my devices even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends signal reception has been the same as my old phone and i have had no issues connecting to the network wifi connections are as expected and i have had no issuesi dropped in a gb micro sd card and it is working as expected i have not had a chance to test out the nfc connection but it has  it is nice to have this capabilitythe real shocker is the sound quality the front facing stereo speakers are really impressive they are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion everyone ive demoed this for has had the same reaction whoa that is impressive are you going to replace your home sound system of course not but you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers the other surprise was from the included ear buds i was not expecting much but they sound pretty good for being included in the box they have flat no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces they are a little flat sounding in the mid range but not objectionably so they will not replace my more expensive ear buds but if these were the only ones i had im not sure i would be that quick to replace them i definitely will not be throwing these outall in all i am very happy with this phone it has great features and the sounds is incredible on top of all that it functions well as a phone in my opinion this is a good value for the money,positive
  yes the charging port needs the mm micro usb i took a dremel and removed about mm from the bottom where the usb plugs in and blended it to the contour of the phone now a standard micro usb fits  yes the keyboard is small you know this phone is small do of course the keyboard is small i physically turn the phone to landscape when i text this makes the keyboard about the same size as the portrait keyboard of my galaxy s  yes the battery is tiny after it hits  it drops super fast the phone is smaller than a credit card i do get a full day out it i use it for phone calls  a little music and texting i do not watch videos or browse the web with this as it is micro sized  yes this has full android with the play store you can install any app that any other phone running  can install  yes this will fit in the coin pocket of pants it is micro sized it does have a lanyard slot which i use so i do not lost this phoneit has a launcher installed that reminds me of an iphone in that all the apps are on the home screen there is no app drawer you can install another launcher if you wantquadrant scorestotal cpu mem io d d asus transformer performance is comparablevellamometal browser multi core ,positive

phone works wonderfully for what i paid i got it as a steal if you are struggling but you need a phone with no contract this is a great choice,positive
i got this phone from amazon in august and still love it i love the larger size slightly heavier weight than other cell phones fit and finish i have big hands and hate how small some cell phones are i put an  gb memory card in it and it holds tons of songs pictures ringtones etc with room to spare the sound quality cannot be beat i hear people loud and clear and they hear me paired with a motorola  series bluetooth headset from costco it works flawlessly no one ever complains about background noise the screen size is bright and clear the camera feature takes decent pictures but its not a true replacement for a digital camera it will get you by if needed though recorded videos have a wave effect if you do not hold the phone steady but overall great audio recording abilities i have not used the gps feature i only text a few messages per day and it takes some getting used to with the keys the keys are small metal buttons that you push after a while you become used to it i think i would want a full qwerty keyboard if i did a lot of textingthe top of the phone is shiny which can lead to it being slippery the back has a somewhat tacky feel to it i ended up purchasing a black rubberized grip phone protector that snaps to the front and back of this phone purchased on amazon i would not use the phone without one because it is an expensive phone to drop and i would hate to scratch itthe phone remains locked if it is in the closed position this avoids accidentally calling people to answer it you just slide it open andor hit the green answer button the slider has a very solid feel to it the best way to describe it is that it feels like solid metal pieces compared to plastic pieces of cheaper slidersthis phone was great when the power goes out because you can shuffle through your music and it has a decent sounding speaker you can also use the camera flash which is really just a bright led light as a flashlight if you need onedue to the shininess of the front of the phone i found it easiest to clean off oil and fingerprints by wiping the phone down with a microfiber towel battery power is good if you do not talk a whole lot it will last you several days if you talk moderate to a lot andor listen to music through the speaker then of course you will have to charge it more often the phone can be charged over your usb port on your computer pick up a car charger for a few bucks and you shall  you will always be able to charge iti have not had any problems with dropped calls through att with this phone which is a big change from my prior sony ericson za worst phone everif you want a nice looking solid built phone with great call quality and nice features then this phone is for you if you want to text all day long or play a ton of games then you might want something else,positive
this phone is just the best for the price camera is amazing but not perfect low light performance make sure you buy from a seller who has listed it as the us version and not the chinese one otherwise you will have a different experience than everyone who reviews it,positive
good package  nice phone  as per my expectations  thanks,positive

i have been using this phone for three days now i was impressed that the phone was delivered sooner than expected the box was sealed and everything was intact my only problem is that this phone came with a plug you use in europe and where i live we use the plugs used in the us not a big problem since i can charge the phone with other chargers i bought the international version since i read that the exynos chip is better than snapdragon i previously used a samsung s which recently died and it was not a difficult transition i also have a p lite which in my opinion takes better selfies id still buy the s edge again though the phone is very fast battery life is exceptional i have only charged it once so far and it still has  of battery life left i also love that the phone is very loud the phone fits easily in my small hands and is pretty light i also love being able to unlock the phone with my fingerprint i also love that the speaker is very loud for someone who has  who is hard of hearing like me that is a plus,positive

this phone was one hundred and twenty dollars cheaper than the same one being sold at att locations there is one drawback however which may prevent someone from actually purchasing this phone the unlocked phone is apparently a canadian import or set up for internet service in canada with telus you cannot alter the browsing profile on this particular phone therefore there will be no way to be able to access the att mobile internet otherwise the phone works perfectly fine on the att calling network if you do not care about being able to access the internet on your phone this is definately the way to go and will save you money in purchasing this model phone outright rather than upgrading f,positive
the phone works quite well and smooth i like it,positive
after previously owning a galaxy light the a has exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds my favorite part about the a is its durability ive dropped this phone about  times over the past  months that ive owned it and it still operates fine with no physical damage at all scratches cracks etc it runs programs quickly with no lag time and the speaker is loud and clear whether you are on the phone or listening to music the camera quality is spectacular and it has  it is easy to edit or alter your photos if you choose to do so the only negative i have about the a is that it has  it is a little too big for my liking but that has  that is just my opinion overall the a is worth your money  stars,positive
the phone is awesome i like it very much and beside the fact that it fit in y pocket its fast and full of surprises the camera is wonderful it is the phone i was looking for,positive

i love this phone sold phones at fry electronics in cal,positive
im really happy with the s even though there is nothing ground breaking in the phone itself i like the larger screen size in comparison to the s as well as the added ram that greatly speeds up the productivity of running apps my suggestion to anyone thinking about this phone is to purchased it unlocked and then sign up with one of the cheaper carriers like straight talk or metro pcs i pay  bucks a month now with no contract big savings,positive
i really like this phone,positive
i really love it and it works well,positive
i originally purchased the htc one m when it came out in  i loved the phone  solid beautifully built and with an excellent ui especially blink feed due to my job i traveled all over the country and this phone kept me company and traveled exceptionally well i disabled every app that i did not need and with the power saver never had to worry about not having enough juice for  days i appreciated how htc pushed updates out regularly  service packs for their software and android final android version is  phone survived numerous drops only resulting in a few nicks on the aluminum body with the screen never getting cracked one night out a friend spilled some beer on it and after it dried i started getting a lot of static through the phone jack a call to htc customer support got it back to fine working condition is short order fast friendly and effective customer servicerecently my original m suddenly stopped making phone calls i could call my voicemail and receive text messages but not make phone calls after  hours at the att store trouble shooting the phone they recommended purchasing a new phone even with this model being  years old it was a no brainer to purchase another one for  new the black color is sharp and cleananother item i like about htc is they support unlocking the boot loader to root and install custom roms this is exactly what i did with my old htc one now i use as a pocket computer to stream music and videos to,positive

phone is exactly what i expected the screen is really good and the phone runs very smoothly the battery is awesome has lasted me  hours so far connected on wifi youtube for about and hour and  hours of talking and still has  do not be scared about the gb of ram it really is sufficient if you know how to manage your apps and are not the type to just open a bunch of apps and leave them running you will have no problem at all if you clean your ram up through the multitasking feature whenever you are done with an app my days of shelling out  for a phone are gone btw the phone looks and feels amazing,positive

i really enjoy this phone two months in i have had no problems at all im am a non flagship type of person so when buying unlocked phones i try to do as much research and reading of reviews as i can i understand that some people are really tech savvy and look for certain things out of a phone but at this price clip i just cannot imagine a better phone the asus preloaded software is not too bad once you get used to it does take quite a while to charge but the battery has really good life all the way till the end the camera is so much better than rated when considering and witnessing the quality of flagship cameras this camera will have similar problems as most phones in low light settings but i was pleasantly surprised by the camera quality if this phone is your options check out some of the youtube channels showing different use tricks many people slammed the placing of the power button on top but to be honest i do not think i have ever used it the double tap wake up feature works consistently speaker volume is again not as bad as advertised one other piece of advice would be to buy knew i bought this phone used at first when arrived the box was shredded and the speaker did work and the screen was not responsive returned used version and bought new with no problems i guess my only gag on this phone would the warranty i do not carry multiple phones other than my work issued phone although asus we fix or replace the phones if you do not have multiple phones this could pose a problem,positive

i bought this device th of may after less than two weeks from its official release i am sure others review it much better than me but i will tell you three key points that make me very happy with it first the s has a  inch screen that did not affect the size and was brilliantly engineered second i love that my i supports g lte internet speed is great the last issue is that battery last longer than my previous phone and i love the s view flip cover  very smart idea all in all it worth the money congratulations samsung for your continous progress in all your products,positive

one of the best phone is ever had,positive
have owned the e now for  years and this cell phone still amazes me every day  this is a fantastic smartphone at an unbeatable pricethe workmanship is great the metal casing feels great in the hand the phone is sleek and elegant the full qwerty keyboard is excellent qualityi recently bought an more recent e for my girlfriend but it doesnt measure up to the classic e as the e is made of plastic and feels shoddiermost useful applications i use with the e are the internet radio great  the navigation system with voice guidance the camera for daily practical use the whatsapp chatting application cheaper than texting sportstracker and wifi internet browsingi very much hope nokia will come up with a successor to the e they should keep the same quality build and try to increase the size of the screen without losing the slimness and sleakness of this fantastic cell phone negatives on this phone could be the challenge sometimes of configuring networks etc especially the first time as the gsm operator will typically preconfigure all settings to consume the data network of the gsm operator and it is a challenge to reconfigure everything to reset networks to wifi etc but i recommend this phone  even to this day  if you are doubting betweek the e and the e i would still go for the classic e as the e does not measure upnokia please dont lose this succesful franchise of the e  update it and make it even better  as soon as its out im buying one ,positive

i love this phone,positive
i love this phone i ordered the seafoam green color and it is beautiful i got the lavender purple and white hard case too it can play almost any app the ones that do not work are super high memory which is the only drawback with the  gb storage you will need an sd card as most of the internal storage is for the system operations and google apps it came with a screen protector mines lasted since i bought it it came with a silicone case but i also ordered the case separately from blu the hard case with rubbery protective layer will not fit over the jelly case though it has protected my phone from breaking many times now this phone is still working great the only problem i had was with an blu system update i contacted them and they were helpful but the only solution left was doing a hard reset good thing everything backs up to google and my sim card it made it easy to make it my old phone again i would highly recommend this phone it is cheap but not at all cheap quality and does more than i would expect with a cheap phone,positive
love this phone but what company is this originally from,positive
wonderful quality phone delivered as promised  i am completely satisfied ,positive

i am a college student who was in desperate need of a new cell phone after my old one stopped working because of that i wanted to buy a phone truly worth the money and one that would lastfor someone who is not willing to pay for g service but still wants internet and a modern looking phone this is the perfect cell phone phones like this are very hard to come by because most do require data packages the ones considered smartphones anyway i cannot say how it compares to a smartphone having never owned one but for someone like me it has  it is perfect qwerty keyboard is well spaced text messaging capabilities are wonderful wifi can i stress how important this is it has  it is probably the best feature of the phone wifi is pretty much everywhere nowadays so why buy a smartphone when you can get a phone with wifi capabilities for a much lower price and without having to buy a data planive had it for about  weeks now and i have absolutely no complaints the battery lasts about  days and that has  that is with a good number of hours using it mostly texting or listening to musicso if you want to buy something definitely worth the money that not only functions great but looks great this is the phone for you best  i ever spent,positive
i really like this phone nice size and light weight,positive
perfect gift for my wife,positive
like the  windows  upgraded to  same as my pc do not have to learn a new system fast shipping works as posted and reviews,positive
the htc incredible is a great phone ive had it over two years and it has  it is been bulletproof with great capability however mine recently died so i ordered a replacement from ross cellular not only did it take its sweet time getting here but they sent the wrong phone a small sticker with tiny writing denoting the package as containing an htc incredible smartphone was affixed to a big light blue box prominently emblazoned with the motorola logo the box contained a motorola droid  which im sure is awesome and all but not what i wanted or ordered on the plus side i did an online chat with amazon customer service and they richard were awesome he found a replacement phone backed by amazon and had it to me in less than  hours pow on the downside the phone from cell phones cheap was doa so i just bit the bullet and added a service plan to my verizon bill and i will be exchanging the phone with them overnight for one that works,positive
good smartfhone ,positive
we bought two of these have had them a little less than a week and we love them the brand was actually recommended by the guy in the wireless dept at walmart we have their family wireless plan these phones are a quantum leap from our previous phone the samsung duos small low end entry level smartphone love the larger size i think it has  it is about the size of the galaxy s or the new iphone newer android os jellybean takes some getting used to from gingerbread on out last phone but it has  it is worth the trouble and this phone has a huge amount of space for apps that we could not have on the old phone we also like the dual sim card slots we will take advantage of that on our frequent international trips even though we had smartphones before we really feel like we have come out of ten dark ages if there has  there is one complaint it has  it is that we are having a little trouble with the various ringtones and notification tones otherwise we love our new blu life phones,positive
great does not come with bloatware,positive
as smart phones go this one is an exceptional value it easily matches if not exceed the capabilities of phone that sell  to  times it has  it is price taste the freedom of being off contract and a tad richer the battery life is the best ive seen well twice as good as any apple htc and samsung devices ive had and an hour of video watching may take less than  off it and best of all the phone does not heat up huawei has been bad keeping updates to the os but jellbean to kitkat is imperceptible im not missing anything and their own take on android makes it easy for ios to migrate as there is no app tray all in all a winner every way,positive
this item it excellent product i and joy itthank,positive

when my wife received the ups package which i sent her as a giftshe told me that the black berry was not found in the package and only accessory was found it has  it is nearly drive me madi try to contact with amazon to see if there is any chance to return the cargo via email amazon reply to me without any doubt that i can directly send them back by ups and they would refund methat would be out of mind in chinabut it does work in us especially on amazonthanks for the help from amzon and i really trust the service of amazon which is  worry free,positive
i only owned the phone for a few days and i like it very much so far the screen is awesome very bright and sharp it makes great pictures although i was surprised to find out that you do not need to unlock the phone to take pictures i see possibility of pranks and unauthorized picture taking the phone works so fast compared to my old not so smart smartphone it is amazing how things are changing the phone is lightweight charges fast and the battery last for quite long time i signed up for metropcs my main complaint is that i had to go the store to activate the phone they would not accept the phone online they only list ancient phones in their bring your own page probably to discourage people from buying phones from other places do not buy sim card from the store  online and at walmart it is  the metropcs guy wanted  for the cardupdate i got second s phone white for a family member and activated it with ting service it was very easy i needed to order a gsm sim card from them and it takes a few days to arrive you activate the phone with the sim card then not with the phone itself i am thinking about switching my own service to ting too,positive
works very well thanks,positive
i used it for two years and recently broke it very stupid way  small piece a plastic got inside the slider and cut main wire harness when i close the phonegreat phone i used it in my trip to ny for three days with almost no charging and many times used gps for long gps is very useful and easy to use now i cannot get to galaxys gps interface camera is pretty decent although night pictures could be better wifi really does not take much juice but guys from tech support are useless at least tmobile staff so you will need to google internet settings yourself although i could not find how to use camera neither back camera nor frontwith skype skype itself works fine any way i think i even did not use all features of the phone and it has  it is small small and solid couple years ago i bought it brand new for about  or  bucks so it totally worth the money actually after sony ericsson it has  it is difficult to use something else that was second se i had they are way too good ,positive

bought for my mom works great right out of the box i could have cut her big sim card down and made it work but she lost it tmobile put in a new sim for nothing the people at the corporate stores are very kind only con it has gone down  since i got mine but if you wait too long a newer better one will come out for a little more and you will never get the best for a bargain i offered my mom the opportunity to get a different one she is very happy especially with the large screen,positive

im a cell phone addict i have played with a number of devices ranging from the oneplus  galaxy s and nexus p over the past year i have to say for  with the gb sd card this was a steal the build quality of the device is fantastic it has nfc and a p display the battery while not large seems to work just fine and stamina mode can help extend the life even furtherim averaging about  to  hours of screen on time which for a  mah battery  display and octacore processor is fantastic signal seems to be strong and reliable call quality is good and bluetooth works great the cameras are solid as well ive been snapping pics of my dog performance is solid while it is in fact a mediatek p processor it is more than capable of handling day to day tasks and basic gaming the screen is responsive and clear with good viewing angles and is an amoled panelthe build quality of the phone is top notch it feels great and balanced in your hand and while extremely large is a smaller footprint than an iphone s plus or original nexus  thanks to the bezeless sidesonly thing i wish this had is a fingerprint reader and a tap to wake feature so i did not always need to use the power button other than that i love my new device,positive
small as it looks it has  it is a very functional phone with superior sound quality but you need to train yourself how to use the tiny keyboard,positive
it has  it is a great product,positive
i just say this phone is the best nokia product so far everything works perfect,positive
the phone looks like it was brand new everything works perfect no dents no scratches the shipping was really fast arrived before time usps also it has  it is great that it has  it is unlocked it works perfect with my mexican carrier telcel and im pretty sure i will not have problems using it in the us with tmobile,positive
this watch is the best one there is i bought  of this as gifts when i went to africa i used one for myself and i had no problem what so ever it was easy to put the sim card and you can use blue tooth or ear piece either way you are good to go i will recommend this product  percent,positive
the best phone ive ever owned fast crystal clear display easy to use interface i came from an iphone s a few years ago and moved to the htc one which i liked at first but slowly realized how many problems i had with it it was a great phone but it was fairly slow the camera sucked and the interface was pretty terrible i had a hard time learning it as a former iphone user i almost switched back to iphone but then i considered this galaxy s edge plus i pulled the trigger and bought it on amazon needed this version so i could use it on cricket this phone has not stopped amazing me since i got it the display is big and sharp and crystal clear the photos are in stunning detail and come out beautiful every time the phone is incredibly fast and the interface is really easy to use which could have more to do with android updates than htc vs samsung but idk the edges are not very useful i like being able to read the clock on it at night instead of having to pick up the phone to view the time but other than that they are more of a gimmick but they do look cool so i still count them as a plus the fit and finish of the phone is excellent,positive
exellent phone havent had any problems with it i have read all these crybaby reviews i dont have add there for my phone does not either yea it has  gig of ram but its a phone people not a laptop or tablet there for it works very good the battery life alone is awesome the only draw back is no g lte i live in the northwoods anyways and lte isnt available so it really makes no difference to me why pay  dollars for a phone or get locked in a contract blu offers exellent phones for a very good price,positive
bought for a satisfied customer,positive
this phone is awesome great buy for anyone looking to get more for your money,positive
just what i expected,positive

great phone for the price,positive
im very satisfied with my purchase the shipping was considerably fast the case feels very sturdy however i only have two complaints  there is not an opening for the microsd card slot   once the case is on the tablet it seems to really add a lot of weight im still giving it  stars though because i feel confident that because of all the bulk this will ensure my tablet is protected from just about anything life throws at it,positive
first smart phone exactly as described no problems hope to get another,positive
thanks guys for the article it was what i expected,positive
this phone is absolutely perfect no scratches and it has  it is shipped very fastshout out to a  z tech inc everyone buy there,positive
love my otterbox case freakin fantastic now i can have my toddler use my tablet without too much anxiety of her dropping it ,positive
everyting ok with the phone recomended ,positive
ok i suggest anyone who can use this phone in the us on its network tmobile  att customers this g unlocked smart phone is the one to get while in the us all other brands of new smart phones cost is  and up  this phone is not a well known brand  have not gotten the us marketing that will make this phone cost sky rocket due to gorilla marketing based on the fact this phone has the longest battery life of any android phone it has a huge screen bigger than samsung models without all the blotware that comes on smart phones these daysthe battery life is insane and the speed of the phone its a duel processor fast fast phone  i got this phone for friend of mine who is on tmoblie he had an older smart phone which he had to get a micro sim card for this phone so we went up to tmobile they charge  for one cannot believe tmobile charges their existing customers for a sim card because verizon does not but they are on  different kind of networks the only con to this phone is that it does not work with the hdmi adapter i have to stream my phone and videos to my flat screen tvso i guess going to get that chrome cast or some type of adapter that will display my phone onto tvs there is a cdma version that for sell to use on the verizon network  i just not sure if i want to get the phone because i like to stream my video through my hdmi cord w my motorola razr phone  overall this phone is a great buy for a brand new smart phone get this phone before the brand really start marketing in the usa which will make the price go up ,positive
very fast and reliable excellent product,positive
i love this phone  everything perfect on this phone,positive
this watch so far is fantastic for value for the price my  year old is using it as a cell phone i wish the band could be smaller and he has  he is mentioned that his wrist sweats a bit not overly bothersome though he absolutely loves it there is also a learning curve since there is no detailed manual that i could online,positive
i love this phones camerait takes fantastic pics most people will remark on this feature when i send them pictures post them on fb etc i would recommend this product,positive
fun phone still learning to use it,positive
the phone did what i needed it to do i did have a problem with the charger port the seller sent me a replacement phonethe seller was awesome sauce the phone was just a phone i did get what i wanted and the price was awesome,positive
for the price this phone deserves the five star rating even though rumors on various forums say no upgrade to lollipop or kitkat for that matter hopefully this will change lots of angry people did a quick sidebyside with a friends galaxy s pretty comparable hard to tell without setting them up with some benchmark software the nonremovable battery is taking some getting used to and unfortunately no sd slot even so it has  it is still worth five stars its fast light and just about perfect for average hand size oh and it takes really good pictures,positive

i got the phone delivered on time and ready to go it was branded but not tmobile att so it will work with the provider i plan to use it on i was alarmed after ordering when i read the customer reviews and they all said it was tmobile branded which would not have worked for me but i guess i got lucky make sure to comment on your order which carrier you need it to be from and i assume they will accomodate you the box had been opened and the phone had been handled but i assume this was only for unlocking purposes as there were no scratches nicks or dents it was just obvious it was not factory packed all components and accessories were included in the packaging so it was a complete package it started up with no problem and functions fully including the g functions,positive
so happy i got the s  it is quick has great security features thin big screen absolutely no issues at all  love it ,positive
amazing product and perfect condition,positive
i purchased this phone in february and wanted to use it for a few months before writing a review i love this phone it does nothing but work it has dual sim slots so i can use it for both my us and uk phones which means only having to carry one phone i love the fact that i can delete apps that i do not use shovel ware that was impossible to do with my att samsung the bluetooth has worked flawlessly ive connected the phone to my small desk speaker and to my car navigation system the audio is loud enough that im not constantly saying what did you say so in my opinion it has  it is a keeper,positive
i was being very patient when it came down to purchasing a new smartphone my last smartphone which was also lg was a little outdated but it worked great when i saw first hand the size of the new wave of phablets i knew i could not purchase a normal sized phone the problem came down to pricing when i first heard of this phone it has  it is size it has  it is features and most importantly it has  it is price i knew i could not pass it up the phone came early i went down to my carrier metro pcs got it set up and bam i love it now this may not be typical but a slight word of caution i have big hands so this phone fits great but i do not feel very confident walking around moving this as i would a normal sized phone the phone is kinda slick and the size in smaller hands might make you a little nervous handling it thankfully they are plenty of options when it comes down to cases that offer grip and protection i have one on the way as i type other than that the phone is a giant freakin winwhy are you still reading this go buy it,positive
product was just as described fast shipping,positive
excellent cell phone the seller sent it and i received in less than hs it has  it is working perfect in my country argentinathis seller is totally recommended,positive

loving this phone it was a great choice fast delivery for it give days after i order it and am from the caribbean,positive

i wanted a new phone without extending my contract so i bought this i remember it was a good phone in  i did not realize how far phones have come since then it workds well and does all i need though,positive
every thing is very goodbut i think the battery is not originalthank you again,positive
met all expectations arrived on time unlocked works perfect with telcel in mexico very good for the price,positive
but great service arrived quickly and exactly as described the phone is insanely slow and the camera is terrible plus theres no memory i had to delete all of my music and pictures before i could use it,positive
extremely good value phone its  inch screen is only p but it makes up for it with the beautiful amoled colors it offers the blu vivo s unibody metall design is also a big plus for a  dollar phone like this another big plus would be its battery as the p plus amoled combo really saves that so you can use the phone for up to  and a half hours of on screen time the blu ui isnt bad but it is not stock android either it does not include an app drawer but you could slap nova launcher on there and be fine the only other con i could think of would be its camera which isnt too great or to bad do not be expecting lg v quality on the camera ps for clarification it does not have a fingerprint scanner unlike the honor x this phones biggest rival as well if the fingerprint scanner is more important to you then design feel free to buy that one,positive
great phone for the price and easy to use and you can go with any cell carrier,positive
came as stated,positive
smart easy to use nice excellent display and oustanding resolution ill recommend you to buy,positive

great phone it has a lot of space for everything you need and more phone has great battery life  hours  if you are listening to music and playing games steadily rear camera is insanely awesome  picture is so clear its like looking at the real thingditto with videos i love this phone i sometimes wish it had an interchangeable cover but that is not a deal breaker,positive
for the wife she has  she is happy so im happy she uses it constantly does it all we keep high end products for yearsso it is economical for us,positive
this product for the price it has  it is going at is very good surprisingly the build of it feels very nice and has good weight to it as does the apple watch it sucks that the screen is not hd but then again nothing under  on a smartwatch does at least to my knowledge the strap feels good in the hands and can probably last you a couple months or years depending on how well you take care of it,positive
excellent phone esasy to use fast and good screen,positive
nice phone,positive
quickly received great product good quality and incredibly low price,positive
if you are shopping for a new samsung smartphone but are shocked by the prices you may want to consider this one it came new in the box the only thing you shall  you will have to get is a sd card for iti decided on this phone due to lack of options for upgrades with my carrier and ultrahigh prices from other sourcesit comes with the charger cord outlet adapter and a set of earphones,positive

great pictures and works like a charm,positive
excellent i love this phone original got it all claire with all its accessoires,positive
this is a great phone for its price while it may not have the best hardware available it is one of the best deals the battery will usually last me all day on one charge and if i need to top it off only a few minutes on the charger will give me hours of life back it is sleek and smooth when switching between apps and settings the lack of bloatware is really nice and frees up space you can use it with any phone carrier without having to do anything and it can use wifi calling highly suggest this for people who do not mind the best hardware but still want a phenomenal phone,positive

very good no complaints so far,positive
just received this phone and there is not much to add to the others reviews except to reiterate that it is a very quality and durable handset i dropped it four feet onto concrete this evening and not a scratch the only thing i want to add is that another reviewer stated this was the docomo version which would mean japanese and with a locked down bootloader but the model i received from ranas electronics was not the docomo variant the bootloader was fully unlockable i know this matters to a lot of people and i was very pleasantly surprised as i thought i had made a mistake and was going to have to live with rooted stock for the life of this phone,positive
it s perfect,positive
this is an amazing product well the only thing this cell phone bothers me is the scarce of accessory actually ive been looking for a new cover case like the whole month but did not see any thing any suggestion blus user i appreciate that,positive
thank you is wonderful a,positive
very good phone with accessories original extras and box very good excuse for not describe them in a negative way but this solution was all set thanks for the help to fix it in the following purchases like your help i hope,positive
wonderful for the price,positive
only had the phone a day so keep that in mind when reading this reviewmy last phone was the nexus  i had it just under  years great phone its lack of lte bands and limited space gb with no sd card was a problem other than that id still have the phone i have no interest in paying the premium for a flagship phone as midrange phones are plenty for my needs i tried a couple different refurbished phones but each on had problemsi assume because they were usedrefurbished so i knew i had to go with a new phone i did get the invite for the oneplus x but canceled my order when i decided that it lack too many lte bands to be as useful as it could be in the us really band  was the only option i was thinking about getting a z but even used ones were still way too expensive imo so i saw this onei knew when i ordered it that it was not a flagship phone it has a megapixal camera which is not flagship quality butits not a flagship the battery is only  which is low compared to flagship butits not a flagship phone cpunot flagship quality but you knowits not a flagship phone but it is also  the price of a flagship phone it offers all the gsm lte bands you could want for the us its thin the battery is not  days as sony says but in the  day ive had it ive been impressed nexus  was smaller battery so this better camera is only megapixal but its better than the megapixal i was use to its practically stock android something i am use toon a personal note i like the design of the phone i never liked the rounded back you get on many phones now a days i like when my lays on a table that it does not rock when you click on the screen i like the relatively squared corners of the m it gives the illusion of a good phone to screen size ratio i completely understand others might not share these opinions its just my preferencefor the money its a good phone for now ill give it  stars as my limited experience has been nothing but greatwhile i appreciate what flagship phones give you my nexus  was a flagship phone in its time and i could afford it if i wanted but what you get for the cost just does not out weigh a number of midrange phones priced in the  rangeedit   weekabsolutely no complaints its a beautiful phoneespecially in its price range the battery has been absolutely fantastic for my use i am confident i could get almost  days on my normal use my more significant use when my son gets his hands on it does drain the battery faster but i can still get over a day with it this is the first phone ive had where i know i do not have to plug it in during the day and can probably skip charging every nightedit   monthsfantastic phone for the money i am shocked how good it is it is only running lollipop but i can only assume that the sony customization to the os has added something to improve battery life like what marshmallow gives you today when i am at work i probably listen to music from the sd card for about  hours a day add in a little internet usage throughout the day and i still have  battery life by the end of the day as i said before when pushed the phone can drain quickly son playing lots of games or watching youtube videos but for my normal usage this is quite nice for me my nexus  would not make to the end of my work day without needing to be plugged in if i did the same thing music and some internet browsingthe camera is well the camera itself is quite nice but the sony camera software is not quite right its slow the android camera app is a definite improvement so i am not going to change my  star review for a slow camera app that would be sillyi did find one problem though i had paired my phone with my car honda fit everything was working fine for daysweeks then one day i realized the car was not informing me of text messages from my phone seems the phone had some sort of issue with bluetooth and its saved pairing with the car seemed broken i had to delete the pairing my phone and car had and recreate the pairing its been fine since then not sure what happened or what caused the issue but all seems fine now i suppose if i could do  stars id consider lowering my review but since i cannot i am sticking with  as i think it is better that  stars plusits possible my car was the problem and not the phone but i did not have this problem with my previous phoneanywayslove the phone,positive

this phone has been fantastic i upgraded from the original samsung galaxy and definitely wanted to get away from samsung my old galaxy seemed to be exemplary of what you get from samsung  a product that is initially great but quickly begins to slow down and wear out my guess is that samsung uses a lot of cheaper components in their phones which makes them cheaper to manufacture and to satisfy demands that might be great for the customer who wants to turn over their phone every year or so but i like to stick with my tech for a while at least until something significantly better comes aroundoverall i love this phone and have been using it for several months now i guess ill describe the features of the phone in a bit more detail below as of right now i cannot name any specific complaints with the phoneaestheticsthis phone is gorgeous i was not sure how i would adapt to having such a huge screen but i can now say that it was really easy to get used to it the screen is ample and the resolution and color fidelity is impressive the aluminum body gives the whole phone a feeling that makes you recognize just how care and thought went into the design and fabrication of the phone it also matches my macbook pro really well which is just a fun little bonus for mei could not bring myself to put a case on my phone im a very careful person especially with things of high value like a smartphone so i think ill be okay after a few months of regular usage there are little to no scratches on the body and i still get to enjoy having all my friends drool over the phone when i take it outspeakersprobably the first thing that just really impressed me about the phone was the very loud and nice sounding speakers im very picky about sound and audio quality so im not comparing them to the great sound you get from things like swan klipsch etc that being said these speakers hold their own compared to builtin laptop speakers and blow other phones out of the water it has  it is really nice for watching videos and listening to music when you do not have a dedicated speaker to connect your phone tokeep in mind though the speakers are loud but they cannot really compete with ambient noise to get the most out of listening to the speakers you will need to be in a relatively quiet place that has some decent acoustics so the sound can resonate a bit for example they sound great in my bedroom which is a relatively small x room but the overall effect diminishes when i play them outside in the courtyard or lawn this of course is to be expected with any sound system so you cannot really complaincamerai was really excited about the camera for taking lowlight pictures in concerts the first time i tried it though the camera just totally failed to produce any good images i know quite a bit about photography so it seemed to me that the software was trying to compensate for the average lowlight by really blowing out the iso this would normally work to produce a terribly quality picture that is nonetheless in focus unfortunately since concerts are generally a blend of extreme darkness offstage and very bright lights onstage this ends up blowing out the stage and the phone cannot figure out what to focus on i basically got a lot of blurry pictures of what looks like glowing humanoids in a dark roomi was pretty disappointed with the results especially after comparing photos with my friends iphone  knowing the specs of the camera i feel that this is largely a software issue and frankly if i had full control over iso shutter speed and aperture i could probably get this to take great pictureswhile there is not a way to control shutter speed and aperture as far as i can tell you can control the iso so the next concert i went to i capped the iso at  and voila the camera was able to distinguish the band and take really pretty good picturesafter figuring out what i needed to tinker with to get good pictures the cameras other software and features really started to shine the continuous shooting option allows you to take a burst of images and select the best one which was great for capturing dynamic moments on stage another feature ive come to love is the panorama shot outside of concertphotography of course and the zoei originally thought the zoe was kind of a dumb gimmicky thing and part of me still does believe that however it is really kind of cool to have you gallery of events on your phone complete with little minimovies that just makes it easy to feel like you are relieving the moment sadly there are no good ways of getting these files off your phonethere has  there is a lot of other great tricks as well which i have not fully explored if you are interested there has  there is lots of articles out there on getting the most out of the htc ones camera id recommend giving them a lookperformancereally not much to say here besides the fact that the one is just blazing fast it has  it is fast at everything it does the only time it is not fast it has  it is because the data connection is crap but that happens rarely in bostonblinkfeedi kind of thought i would not like this unremovable feature that comes with the one i definitely changed my homescreen but i often find mysel fusing blinkfeed im really really really busy im sure a lot of you are also really busy for me at least this has translated to me being pretty far removed from what has  what is going on in the rest of the world that has  that is where blinkfeed comes in to provide me with something i did not have super easy access to before  news it has  it is all right there constantly updating a feed of news based on what you are interested in it has  it is like having an electronic newspaper on hand all the time for that reason ive really loved itthat has  that is about it in terms of the features that immediately come to mind hopefully you have found this review helpful if you are torn between getting the one of the samsung i would really recommend the one i have owned many samsung products over the years and have had many friends with their products as well overall they just do not seem to last very long i feel that samsung is just under the impression that its customers will not be keeping their products for much longer than a year so they do not build them to last much longer than thatif you want a solidly constructed android phone that will both last you a long time and offer you everything you could want from the top smartphones on the market today this is your guy,positive
best phone ive had yet really happy with it very fast the battery lasts very long and the camera is really really good whenever my friends take pictures they always ask for my phone because the camera is just so much better if you are an adroid person and you are looking for your flagship phone do not look any furtherif you are in the usa this comes with a default european adapter plug and us converter,positive
nice phone my wife likes the camera specially the front with flash,positive
this is an awesome phone and one of the best values for your dollar if not the best the screen pops the speed is excellent no lag at all the motorola specific features are industry leading and the battery life is above the average of the top shelf competitors i would recommend this phone to a friend,positive

i was extreamly skeptical about buying a used iphone that i could not even see what it looked like the description said it was in good condition and came with a case and charger i received my phone  days before the scheduled delivery date when i opened the package it made me very weary about it being in a envelope i was pleased to see that the phone had absolutely no scratches or cracks when i turned it on it worked perfect my phone looks brand new and you would never know it was used i am one happy customer i have not activated it yet but if i have a problem i will be sending it back but im sure i wont defiantly recommend buying one you will not be let down,positive

the best audio the most vivid colors fast enough altough average camera i did not expect much about this last point because of the comments i read before i bought it,positive
brilliantcame in the box has a nice sticker over the side that states do not accept if seal is brokeninside the box is a shiny new s smfd phone with all the plastic still in placeunder that is the sn and id data sheet  sticker do not looseunder that a quick start guidebelow that you find the charger euro cables earbuds and a euro to us plug adapter for the charger but since its basically a usb adapter any usb phone charger should work fine check the voltages thoughsome people seem to have been confused by the euro charger im guessing the term international did not quite hit home for themthe screen is untouched the back is untouched and apart from the addition of the us adapter its a perfectly fine almost straight from the factory boxjust make sure you check the upc on the box before you break the sealmy only quibble is the packaging no kind of bubble wrap or shock material at all the package was snug around the box so it did not bounce around in the box but there was little in the way of shock absorbing materials ups delivered the package un molested though,positive
thank you,positive

diamond in the rough that about sums up the type of product blu has created first let me paint a picture for you i previously had a samsung s as my daily driver but unfortunately after a great weekend in vegas and a sick cannonball into the rehab pool party i had to downgrade to a moto e nd gen i probably struggled for  solid months deciding on a backup device i saw the moto x purestyle and thought that was it this is the one then i saw the price drop in the nexus  and thought that has  that is an amazing deal for what you get then i stumbled upon the blu pure xl through android authority i did my research and went with my instincts and grabbed the pure xlprosinsanely fastquick chargingnear stock androidgorgeous displaymicro sd supportlightning responsive fingerprint readercomes with  cases headphones tempered glass and a usb adapteroutstanding camera frontbackabundance of featuresconsbattery could last a bit longer but with quickcharging you barely notice so semiconcant switch to have apps saved to micro sdthe speed on this device is ridiculous never any lag mx pages mx games open never any slow down camera quality is great for me now im not a camera enthusiast but all of my photos come out crisp and with great color one great feature i was playing around a enjoyed was that you can plug in a portable hard drive or usb and readsave files without having to root the phone that blew me away i purchased a gb mirco sd and now i can plug in a usb any time with the included usb adapter i got all the gigs bih plies vc bang bang bang for your buck incredibly pleased with my buy and would recommend this device to any hardcore android user,positive
thanks for send the product excellent,positive
i purchased this phone for one of my sons he is a heavy user of its cell phone and he is completely happy with it he was using an iphone gs and the galaxy alpha implied a huge improvementfor him all the applications run very fast and it works with the g lte network which is pretty much faster than the g network great phone,positive
great cell well it has  it is was a long time ago,positive
absolutely love this phone i switched from the iphone s and am veryhappy i was nervous about switching since i have been a long timeiphone user but i can say from what i have experienced so far i feelconfident i made the right choiceso far i have found a fewlittle things that have made me really enjoy the switch the obviousscreen size and resolution on the galaxy s are a huge upgrade from theiphone the camera and video quality is also far superior on the galaxys the keyboard that appears when entering text is highly superior tothe outdated iphone version it may sound small but it is one of myfavorite features the keyboard has numbers across the top which savesme time from jumping from an alpha keyboard to a number keyboard whichis extremely helpful when entering passwords etc also you have theability to access other characters such as commas questions marksdollar sign  and colon from the main keyboard by holding down thecorresponding letter which is another huge time saver the autocorrect and suggestions based on what you are typing is much better  itis easier to select suggestions the suggestions are more relevant andalso include previous entires such as email addresses and it is easierto decline the suggestions or autocorrections a few other smallthings that i really enjoyed was the ease of manipulating photos forwallpaperbackground i have trouble cropping and using an image on myiphone but was easily able to accomplish it on the galaxy i also foundthe alarms much easier to set customize and create a recurringschedule for i have not gotten to test everything yet and i do have toset up and get used to using double twist downloaded app to replaceitunes for my music but so far i am so happy with my switch from aniphoneobviously people have different needs opinions andbiases on what they want in a phone but i am very happy with thefeatures and ease of use of the galaxy s over the iphone,positive

item delivered on time was as described,positive
great phone super powerful fast great resolution lighting fast and my battery life is not too terrible ive cycled it a few times and the battery life keeps on getting betterupdate the  points mentioned below asus update fixed these issues some trickery if you are a line user if you send a emoji your keyboard will stop working solution close the app and reopensome trickery  vine user video will play once then crash grrrfor  im blown away this thing is more powerful than my  laptop incredibly easy to use interface lots of versatility and im especially loving the rounded back whoever thought it would be brilliant to make the back of all phones flat is stupid with this rounded back you are actually cradling the phone rather than holding it by it has  it is edges if you are an android user you shall  you will feel right at home with thisupdate using this phone for a few weeks now and i have to say even with a moderate amount of usage i can get by  days without having to charge the phone with heavy usage  days i cycled the battery by letting it get down to  or so then charging it up this lead to me having to charge the phone at odd times however the battery life is superb unlike what others have reported so far ive also found that using a glass protector  a case  no dice you need to use a plastic screen protector or else the sidespower button area will lift this was frustrating since i bought a premium tempered glass protector that i had to remove after  weeksanother thing that needs mentioning it may be because of a hidden setting but if you are on wifi and send a mms picture or video content at least with tmobile the mms will not send you need to turn off the wifi ive read up on this but still have yet to find a solution even though ive browsed though all of the settings it may be a carrier thing but i find that doubtful also this device sometimes has issues with connecting to certain routers my work router is fairly new but the phone will not connect to it always has not been an issue at home however a third thing is that keyboard support while vast does not allow users to change the layout if you are a multilingual person who uses east asian languages in my case japanese you are limited to the traditional keypad no qwerty support i do believe the only way to bypass this is to install googlerd party keypads which is kind of frustrating since the phone already has the support built in anyone correct me if im wrong lolwithin the next few weeks i should have a new update on using it outside of the us so far best  i ever spent on a phone vastly better than anything else ive used so far when given usability options and price in comparison to samsung and apple,positive
excellent phone works perfectly,positive

i upgraded from a note  and the note  is beautiful i used to have the color white so i purchased the gold i am not a techy person so i wont go too much into detail the only negative things i have to say about the note  is the obvious lack of expandable storage and removable battery but samsung announced they will be bringing it back however i am okay with the storage amount on this devicei was a little nervous about purchasing a phone on amazon especially an international version i was not sure of the difference but i do not notice anything everything arrived safely and on time the phone arrived in an original samsung box with the samsung headphones and a uk style samsung wall adapter i was concerned over this but after doublechecking the box the seller supplied me with a us adapter this was awesome because my phone still recognized it was a fast travel charger even with the adapter i used to have a tmobile note  with a straighttalk micro sim the note  is nano size so i had to purchase a new one transferring my number was an easy process that only lasted a few hours which is normal the smnc note  is g lte capable i was panicking at first because it only said g on the status bar but it is just cosmetic it is g lte but it says g the phone is fast with and without wifii love the galaxy note models because of the s pen on the note  you just pull the s pen out but on this model you have to push it in to get it out it is a little new for me but it is not something i cant get used to the functionality of the s pen is excellent it also looks really nicethere is no lagging on the note  everything processes smoothly i am such a big fan of samsung and i am amazed by all of the things this device can do i am a college student and it just helps me with my daily tasks and i also love to stream videos and music i can tell you the note  screen looks way better on the note  than the note  the note  is a great phone but if you have the chance to upgrade do iti know most of my review was a comparison between note  and  but i was trying to give as much detail as possible  comment if you have any questions,positive

my nokia pos phone starting giving up the ghost and i was faced with either signing up for another two year contract to get a reasonable price or pay through the nose for a noncontract priceafter doing some research i settled on the s monte when it arrived i popped in my sim card and voila well whatever the portuguese word for voila is the language was set to portuguese and i had to fumble my way through the menus trying to find what i thought was a menu option after fumbling for about  minutes i had it switched to english and was offthis is a great little phone for a couple bills i do not have to sign up for the contract and i can kiss off att and go to tmobile if it suits my fancythe wifi is awesome it has  it is sad that us carriers can get away with forcing defeatured phones down our throats and force us into outrageous data plans since i live in mountain view i get free wifi within the city from google so i do not have too much of a need for a data plan when i can use the built in wifithe camera takes great pictures at  megapixels video quality is good as well with a decent frame rate but not the highest resolution qvga good enough for youtube or facebookvoice quality is not the best also i had to go to the uk for a case that conforms to the phone design it also does not have a qwerty keyboard input for texting a couple small sacrifices for a smart phone without a contract a steep price or a monthly gougingvery happy with this phone,positive

i bought this phone to activate on page plus cellular service which requires no flashing phone has an elegant size nice and small just drops in your pocket and i love the qwerty keyboard which is much better then typing on a screen web os has great features that outdo android and the swipe card view and gesture area are nice features for a smartphone phone calls emails and texts perfectly i like adding favorites to dialer menu which makes it easier to find your most contacted people in the dialer app wifi works great to cut down on data usage and if you can live with g when your out and about the phone is for you stock battery life for a pre  is a joke so i went with the mugen power  mah extended battery and back door i average  days between each charging cycle and the extra girth makes it easier to type on the keyboard kind of light on apps for a killed operating system but it is fine for my usage and homebrew apps and tweaks fill in the gaps it has  it is too bad hp killed off the line and we probably will not see another pre on the market get the phone now while you still can and im sure you shall  you will find you cannot live without it,positive
i love this phone fast shipment bought a sim card from straight talk and works perfect this the way to go if you do not want an expensive phone plan,positive

great productmade a wonderful xmas gift for my mom,positive
i wont lie i was surprise by the quality and overall look i did not expect this phone to be so highspeed if you are a net wiz you have to get this phone as far as emails it could have retrieved them faster but overall it is fast on a world wide web i love the sound mic works perfectclearer then the actual phone it slim looks expensive and is flashy for those who like to look rich and famouslol that was a joke overall software worked fine i sync everything i needed mirco sd fits in perfectly up to  gb of storage which is more then enough trust me whatever storage phone provides ringtones are playing nice and clear well is there anything wrong with this phone besides the fact that it attracts some attentionno lolyou wont regret and its so much cheaper with this seller then on bestbuy or else where,positive
this phone will prpbably not explode in your pocket and i really like mine a lot fast light and stylish lack of an additional sd card storage slot is a negative only really minor issue is with the fingerprint unlock function which is more of a software problem,positive
i love this phone especially for texting it is great and locks automatically when i am done using it which i like there was a problem with the battery wearing down very quickly  i had to charge it very other day i wrote to mmworks from whom i purchased it through amazon and they sent me another one free of charge and did not require me to return the battery i had i really appreciated them doing that for me all in all it has  it is been a great phone i only use it for calls and text at this time  not email i love it,positive
wish the phone worked with us cellular,positive
fantastic phone,positive
wow top production super condition exactly as described thanks,positive
great and cheap needed this phone for international use and worked great,positive
i was really worried that this phone would not work with my service but it does i am so excited this is a great phone one thing that i want to express is that my mom has a black slvr l and it has different ringtones and wallpapers than mine some are the same so if your buddy has a phone that they bought from america and you want it just because of the wall papers or something like that do not buy it it is a wonderful phone and gets great reception at my house which is out of the city big accomplishment i love this phone and am so happy that i purchased it,positive

i love the blu phones this is my second one this year and not because there is anything wrong with my blu studio  hd i have just opted to upgrade to a phone with a slightly smaller screen and better battery life for the price of these phones you cannot go wrong setup is a breeze customization is easy colors are vibrant phone is light even with a rugged case battery life is better than any phone i have ever had screen is responsive to touch unlike some other phonesi have had no issue with volume or music playback as other reviewers have noted all in all a great phone for a little price everyone should give blu a try,positive
met all my expectations love my phone,positive

good phone for teenager or kids no issues,positive
i absolutely love my blu vivo  it is everything i need in a cell phone and more,positive
although the phone arrived locked the seller replied to my message within one day with the unlock code the phone is otherwise perfect and exactly as described g works without a hitch in australiaamazing build quality as always from nokiamicrosoft price and the chipset aside it truly feels like a premium flagship but luckily the windows os is very light and speedy so it does not need the overbearing cpu power and ram that android devices need to run smoothly the camera is an absolute joy in good and bad light color reproduction is spot on and very vibrant zero complaint about the phone i could care less about the congested app store on android and ios i just want a simplistic solid premium phone and this is just thatthe seller was breed very well mannered and despite needing one more day to get the phone unlocked i really appreciate how quickly resolved the issue for me i would buy from them again for sure but in the future i think it would be better if you guys just shipped the unlock code,positive

this phone is an awesome phone has good sound and more space than most phones package came right on time,positive
i love this gadget although i did not used it due to compatibility issue to the country that i am going to for vacation but i will highly recommend this to everyone,positive
awesome beast of a phone i am more than pleased with the moto g plus so far and it is not as big as i feared though i would never call it small especially to its face for the price i just do not see how you can find a better end user experience the os is speedy the camera is more than capable comes with almost zero bloatware and probably has more storage space than ill ever need i paid for the  gb version because i wanted the  gb ram to help ensure i do not have issues with lag both now and down the road and the extra  seems to be totally worth it,positive
best phone for its price no other phone in the same price range comes close to what you get from ,positive
the best phone i bought i dont care what other people say but i am very happy with what got read the specs and did the resurch and it was even better than i expected,positive
as more than i expected i loved well everything,positive
perfect i really love it,positive
this is a great phone you could do so much with it it took me a long time to get used to it and when i finally did i ended up trading it for the note  because i get bored with phones very easy i loved this phone when i had it certain things were just really complicated on it as any phone takes a bit to get used to because its something different it was a great purchase i would definitely get another if i had to i actually recommended it to a few friends of mine,positive
replaced my  with this phone wanted to share my internet and the locked  would not allow it i was able to share the connection with this phone with no problems downloaded the spanish keyboard just in case but did not need itthe phone updated pretty quick with no problems and i am quite happy with it,positive
good phone and i like the price and its functionality,positive
i absolutely think this is almost just as good as the galaxy sonly big reason for me is the shas  more gig of ram my only complaint so far is that it goes on and off with reading my sim card but that could also be my carrier i have metro ps with an unlimited glte plan which only makes this phone even more amazing because i can us as much lte as i want it has  it is amazingly fast loads instantly and no glitches so far still trying to get used to lollipop so far but for stop looking it not gonna find a better phone even if you have  to spend,positive
this phone does all that a basic user of smart phones could want the memory is smaller then most put perfectly sized for those who do not need gaming and other big application use draws i find this phone works fine and gets the job done without the price of the other larger priced phones,positive
worth every penny did have to take my phone to metro pcs and they enabled the imei in their system to get service so it has  it is unlocked definitely works bought one then a second a week later for the wife cause it was that good,positive
this is a power house of a phone and i will recommend it any day for some one who is looking for a good phone,positive
my wife loves it not the best phone of course but one of the best for the price screen is very responsive and easy to use no lag or freezes the camera lcd is not the clearest but im use to my galaxy s with a hd screen but it works just fine,positive

okay i have to say that i love this phone it has  it is just the cats meow nice big screen lots of great features inmates calls with no problem there has  there is a lot of reviews that are pre software update about lte problems which have been addressed they have upgraded the software so the battery last longer i do not get me wrong it has  it is still not the longest lasting battery but you get about what you get with your other phones like the samsung galaxy and many of the other phones huawei has this hands down as does apple from what i understand not much i can say bad about this phone few times the speaker has locked up on me and is not heard me when i was answering calls for asking google a question i rebooted a couple times and it has  it is fine it may turn out to be a problem although after the reboot it has  it is been fine as i said for the price i do not know that you can do much better it has  it is a really good phone,positive

i received the xt model this is completely unlocked phone needless to say how good the phone is as so many reviewers has already posted their comments motorola phones are always have value added features like moto assist this phone has surpassed all other phones in features namely assist actions voice and displayinteraction with this phone even when screen is off and cover closed and at a distance is beyond imagination of people who do not own this phone further it comes with the best speech recognition and synthesis better than that found in google now and microsofts cortanai migrated from a moto g  to this phone safely to say motorola is my only choice of phones and my household already have three of them go for it highly recommended a top quality phone with loaded features beyond the operating system which is lollipop ,positive

this is the smartest phone you are going to get in the market  but like any other smartphone it is not perfect  do not misunderstand me i love my moto x and i cannot be happier with my purchase but has its flaws  one is the camera is not the best in the market but meets the basic functions  second battery may not reach the full day but with the motorola turbocharger you have not to worry about it it is the best phoneprice you are gonna find out there,positive
great phone came as described extremely fast shipping received it earlier than expected,positive
it is a great phone it looks nice and works well,positive
great phone took some time to figure out how to set up with strait talk i just needed the correct apn settings,positive
i was a bit nervous to buy from a non carrier but this galaxy has been a beautiful experience i have waited to write a review to give the phone some time to perform the downside was i thought the packaging for such a high priced item was scarce and it was rolling around a bit when it arrive since it was branded with verizon i felt comfortable walking in my verizon store and asking for the transfer of my old phone to the new one my verizon store was awesome and gave me the card i needed to get started specific to the galaxy s i wish that when the phone is charging the screen would go dark but i just touch the button on the side and it does it,positive
it has  it is great i love the color and design the only bad thing about it is that sometimes the onscreen menu stops working and it does not display whatever app i have there i have to turn off the phone and then turn it back on so it works,positive
amazing phone works as promised,positive
right product and fast shipping,positive
had one before bought another it has  it is great,positive
the phone is great i love it except it does not have the same feature of my old phone did like the different call log it does not have out going missed and incoming call they are all in one call log besides that the phone is great and fast it is great to invest your money in and it cost less than what tmobile store is offering yes i would recomend this phone to anyone who is intrested in,positive
i have had the phone for  weeks now and it is just great it is fast the camera is great even in low contidion in fact it is like having a camera that you can talk through videos are just incredible the screen look just perfect do not believe all you read i saw a lot of reviews that criticized the quality of the screen it looks great it has  it is perfect image true colors as far as games you can play whatever you want no glitchesi am more than pleased with this phone money well spent,positive

i bought this phone late in the game not long before this years  iteration will launch so will skip the overview of all the specs and how it stacks up against its competitors and all that i wish i was a tech journalist nonsensei was not shopping this phone against its competitors but its predecessor the original  release of the moto x and several other phones in the ish range i bought it at  usd just  more than i could have bought its predecessor as new old stock but lightly usedit has impressed me so far ive used a few android devices including a smartphone motorola droid razr maxx can we add any more names to this thing that i used without a sim essentially as a miniature tablet for wifi use with a motorola tundra as my talktext device until the tundra finally diedso since it has  it is about to be outdated why do not we look at this phone in detail but without the brand new shiny thing glasses of release day and from the perspective of someone who has used but not relied upon smartphones for some timefirst it looks good in my case with a white front and bamboo back i like it even if im not a fan of white on phones i do not care my phones made of g bamboo that has  that is awesomewhen you ask for things to happen they happen this applies to general performance with touch interaction as well as voice motion etc without the task bar of a pc i lose track of all the things running but ive been shocked when i remember to check on this phone it runs all of your favorite boring things like facebook your banks app  tabs of different lemon cake recipes parts searches for a  geo tracker a  honda element and how to trim your micro sd card into a nano sd card at the same time while playing musicdurability as soon as i have the money after this purchase yes im broke who else buys yearold phones offcontract to use on consumer cellular yeah the elderly are they writing long reviews on amazon no they are not moving on anyway as soon as i have the money ill be getting an otterbox defender case for this i love the bamboo and i ordered a somewhat protective case with a frosted transparent back for it at the same time as the phone but i kill phones and this one does not feed especially durable not that i expect it to it has  it is a big ol ball of performance and fashion statement in a phone and there has  there is no room there for what if it falls of my pocket from a gaoddamn tractorthat has  that is why i will but have not yet dropped the cash on a good casewhat else do you want to know it has  it is quick it works it has  it is getting cheaper as the new version gets closer but it has  it is still a great phone and if you really want to pay retail prices you can still get it customized just think you could have the very last custom  version motorola moto x or you could like me get the best used one you can find and pretend it has  it is exactly the way you want it white front bamboo back ftwanyway it really is a good devicethe last seven words of the last paragraph really should have been my review,positive

the phone is great it works many applications at one time without losing its speed it is unlocked and i can use with my straight talk service as long as i have an att sim card you cannot tether the phone unless perhaps you have att service it has  it is filled with att software which i have no use for since i do not have att service the phone is great i would definitely recommend if you need to run a lot of applications on your phone at once im pleased with it the battery does die after about  hours of continuous use even if it is plugged in so i would recommend buying some spare batteries if you are going to use multiple applications that where are the battery quickly as i do it has no reflection on the phone just a heads up for your information,positive

this is the first time ive gotten an unlocked phone and ill do it again i like the way google has it configured like the way it feels in my hand love the fingerprint sensor most of the time and am otherwise enjoying it initially i only gave it  stars because of the battery life im not a heavy user at all and it did not last a full day but i read other reviews that said to let the battery run down and then charge fully i did that and it has  it is lasting much longer plus it uses a rapid charging system when the battery is low going to full in a very short time like  minutes so now im a happy camper without any complaints,positive
best blackberry i have owned to date world traveler it has worked at every location no dropped calls or problems with connecting to different service providers uses the tmoblie sim state side and an international sim when traveling currently using a country specific sim connects everytime text and calls the phone is very responsive and easy to use tethered to my g blackberry playbook and also linked to my computer keeps files dates appointments and reminders with no issues blackberry is on the right path with this product easier to access the battery sim and memory chip with the one touch removal of the rear case the only issue encountered was a one time drop and the rear case disconnected and the battery shot out since i purchased the skin and no futher issues,positive

i gave this phone to my husband for fathers day mind you he is not one for technology this phone was very easy for him to figure out also keep in mind that his phone before this one was a flip phone it is a juning android dual sim unlocked phone  it is amazing i had my doubts at first but it worked wonderful for him i absolutely fell in love with the old fashioned record player on the main screen to play music i mean i wish i had one on mine i also am very impressed with the packaging and what it came with phones that i have seen do not usually come with everything that this one didwhat it came withphonebatterychargercaseheadphonescasescreen protectorinstructionspros lollipop  software current android software  screen display  back camera speakers great sound quality wifi and bluetooth graphics are amazing very bright touch screen very sensitive multiple apps compatible facebook twitter games pinterest etc  x  pixels colors available blue gold orange pink we got the blue front facing speakercons  gb would like more  mp front camera not good for selfies only works on g or g service only has one case the one that comes with ittip make sure you have your own sim card does not come with onei would highly recommend this product and seller this seller also sells multiple items for every need and want at an excellent pricedisclaimer i received this product for a discounted price for my honest opinion my reviews are  honest and true based on my personal opinion not on a companys description or request no monetary compensation was offered or received,positive

very glad to have a great product at a great price thanks to fast delivery will buy again next time thank you,positive
with a little bit of effort i was able to familiarize myself with this phone and using it became intuitive it came with a nice easy to read booklet and before purchasing it i checked to see if it has a web site which it does i inserted the sim card and charged the battery which took a couple of hours i did have several problems at first but this was my first cell phone so i did not have much experience i mistakenly set the language to portuguese so i could not figure out what to do luckily there were several online tutorials at the web site and i restored the phone to the factory setting once in english i was able to figure the phone out more easily one thing i figured out was to use military time as in pm equal  when setting the time as there was no am or pm setting all in all i am happy with the phone being hearing impaired i am able to hear the basic ring which is loud when i put it in my pocket i face the keypad to my leg as the speaker comes out the back and it has  it is even louder same thing when i set it on the table i put it face down and the ring is loud and clear i questioned about using a lanyard and emailed the jethro company they got right back to me and confirmed that a small hole on the upper left side could accommodate a lanyard by removing the back feeding the lanyard through the hole and looping it around before replacing the back the customer service was nice and answered my question in an easy to understand manner the phone will lock in my pocket so it wont random dial all i need to do is press the  asterisks until the screen says the phone is unlocked then i can dial out the phone always accepts a call without turning it on this is exactly the simple phone i was looking for i returned several that did not work i went with this model so i can use it with consumer cellular which is less expensive for  with my aarp discount i get  hours of talk per month,positive
really loved it,positive

i gave this phone  stars due to the fact my wife wanted a basic phone without paying extra for a data package inwhich she does not use this phone is a great buy for the price you can text like crazy if you are a textee  although the keys are kinda small but for some reason i believe texters would not have any other way it takes good pictures for the type of phone and the calls are very clear it has  it is even bluetooth ready and connects very easily lg env vx may just be on to something,positive

i got tired of just going with the mainstream brands and looked for a more fairly priced alternative i saw this model on amazon and decided to take my chancesended up being a smart move the overall quality has the look and feel of one those other more expensive phonesno issues adding apps and the graphics look great too the screen size is nice good enough to watch movies etc but not too big that makes it harder to hold in your hand or put in a pocket contemplating buying a second one as a gift,positive

i think it is worth sharing my story so you can learn from my lessons i had an inexpensive model g vigor phone from my cell provider that in itself was a mistake a low grade phone for  in addition i got the insurance for  per month over the course of  months the phone slowly degraded first bluetooth randomly disconnected from my car and bluetooth speaker then the phone ran out of memory so i got an sd card for pictures and video then calls started dropping and performance kept degrading to the point where it took a few seconds to pull up the home screen and i had to keep closing apps to get it to perform at least reasonably i finally had enough and made an insurance claim which was accepted but with a  deductible the replacement phone was a slightly lesser model of phone an escape  which came with so much bloatware from my carrier i could not even install my regular applications this newer phone was slower than the original the overall experience was quite frustrating so i decided to do my homework and after much research of midgrade phones i decided on the moto g plusi picked up the top unlocked model available in july  gb and gb ram bundled with a  amazon gift card for  so i essentially go the phone for  now that has  that is inexpensive the phone has  gb available storage with gb reserved for the os the octacore processor and gb of ram make this baby scream i keep several applications open at the same time and fly between them without pause the camera has some very nice features for a phone at this price point perhaps the only desired feature would be image stabilization but most phones with that feature start at twice the cost of this one the pictures are much nicer than with my more expensive g vigor and other phones ive used s g the plus has a fingerprint reader which is awesome for unlocking the screen after training the fingerprint reader i just touch my thumb on it and the phone instantly unlocks wicked coolthere are two lacking of the g plus in my estimation only p video at a time when phones are starting to record k and pretty crummy internal speakers they work great for phone calls but music sounds pretty tinny to be fair i have not heard a phone whose speakers had me impressed but i have heard better from other phones that said i use a bluetooth speaker for music which sounds greatas for insurance i do not think it has  it is worth the price when you consider the deductible i will put  away each month  of that comes from the  i saved cancelling the crummy insurance plan by the end of  months ill have enough saved to replace the phone,positive
it is a great product i have no complaints on it,positive
nice phone everything i was looking for  the first  days were dificult to get use ir burro after thad it became asoweme,positive
one of the best smartphone for the year  and it still is nice canera with laser good camcorder sound is loud and cleardisplay is very attractive in comparison with other smartphones the phone is also fast with the gb ram,positive
i never understood why people do not shop around and realize that there are other alternatives besides the iphone i do not know if people realize that the iphone  is incredibly expensive the phone retails for  to  dollars depending on the model and more expensive than a desktop computer in most cases when you sign up for a plan you are paying close to x for the phone because of the expensive voicedata plan there is no reason why you should be paying more that  per month for a unlimited talk and text with g of data the average cell phone bill with the iphone from the top cell companies range from  to  dollars per month that extra money per month can buy  iphones over the course of your  month contract now lets get to the blu studio excellent phone fast smooth great color screen great touch control fast lte internet puts the big samusng htc and motorola to shame it has a large  inch screen and not two wide so its easy to hold in the hand this is definitely a winner i have own iphones and samsung galaxys in the past and for this price its a no brainer,positive
quality iphone,positive

phone sucks but i kinda figured that from the get go it has  it is a budget dumb phone so i knew what i was purchasing no need to knock off any stars from my rating since it met my expectations ,positive
this phone definitely rivals the more expensive samsung galaxy the camera is truly a wonder it has amazing filters and even without a filter the picture is captured clear and in high definition the largan lense really does take wide photos so more backgroundscenerypeople fit in photos it works excellent in low light and the flash is excellentthe dualsim card feature holds both a mini sim card and micro sim card the screen shows excellent colors at high definitionthe storage is amazing the phone has gb for storage but after gb are used for the android operating system there is still a lot of room for apps etc the phone can hold a micro sd memory card for my storage space i currently have  apps installed and still have almost gb of storage leftthis is definitely a modern and high tech smart phone the processor is fast the apps all run fast and download quickly the email is easy to set upthe call volume is somewhat on the quieter side even at max volume but this is is not a problem if you just hold the phone higher up on your earthe phone itself is thin and lightweight it charges quickly a full charge in less than  hours the battery lasts about  days of constant use i mean constant like i could not put this amazing phone down and about  days when it has  it is on standbydefinitely recommend for a great unlocked smartphone that is comparable to the name brands samsung i would buy it again a million times over,positive
awesome and friendly usable phone,positive

this is a good looking phone feels sturdy and well built nice enough features the camera though toted as mp the quality after the shot leaves much to be desired but for the moneyits aight it has  it is workable the battery seems to last almost as long as advertised with moderate usage which is great,positive
the device is an excellent feature filled unit this is premium for just about average price my device updated from android lollipop  to  when i connected to the internet this unit is fast enough to create a smooth user experience for regular use and gaming the phone is full of features that will require a bit extra time to get over that learning curve especially the camera for the novice apps such as clean master really did not need to be a part of built in system apps other than minor bloatware the user experience is on par with most high end devices no nfc no problem you pretty much get everything else,positive

coming from htc one m this phone is a huge upgrade across the board even the audio experience is x better which is saying a lot considering that htc one m used to be king of audio this phone also looks like it was designed by a jewel crafter or watch maker you have to see it in person to appreciate its beauty super fast and fluid really nice software touches instant fingerprint sensor can store  fingers amazing display this phone easily goes toe to toe with the s and in my opinion is a good bit better then lg g easily beats htc  oneplus etc the s is really its only competition and at this price point there is no comparison,positive
i love it it works get on metro pcs i live in nyc no complaints,positive
exactly as described knocked and arrived in excellent condition,positive

im so enamored this will likely be a multiple update reviewunboxing phone documentation which was immediately tossed aside head phones with different sized buds ac charger with eu adapter and usb datacharging cablesetup i pulled all the fun clings off opened the back easy easy slipped in the etisalat af sim card and sandisk gb microsd turned it on did not get the normal welcome screen where i get to choose the language maybe i was playing with something and missed it wound up choosing some slavic language which a friend of mine was able to read he also identified the life companion title on the lock screen as french got through the wifi log in changed the language and logged into google normal process from therespeakers and microphone the sound is pretty loud when it has  it is turned upi was actually startled at the notification of a message the stock keyboard and i do not get along my hands from base of palm to middle fingertip barely reach six inches cm this is a big phone love it to death but the spacing of the stock keyboard means i wind up hitting b or n instead of the spacebar even in portrait personal problem i know i had the phone on speaker when i called etisalat to make sure the messages i get in the future are in english they heard me and i heard them almost as clearly as if i were using the handset directly the rep did not even notice the generator running in the backgroundcamera the camera works ok there was a bit of fuzz on a still i took of a friend indoors admittedly the lighting was not all that fantastic but i think it should have come out a little better im coming from a motorola razr maxx hd technically speaking this camera should make the one im used to go cry for mummy ill update later when ive used it more in different situations  update camera works very well ive taken many pictures in different lighting and all of them come out very well it helps to not be too close to what you are trying to photograph i used skype to see if what i see on my screen is anything like what the other end sees called my friend on his motorola razr hd and there was little degradationfuzziness from me to him but it seemed like normal conversion degradationthe hardware in general makes me a bit giddy there was some semi glitching when opening the app drawer which disappeared when i installed google edition  that may have something to do with all the preinstalled apps videos and offscreen goodness run smoothly ill post updates as nifty things come up update ive been able to see a movie have apps update in the background and have a phone conversation at the same time without the movie picture stuttering i cannot play a movie and have apps update on other phones the movie losesi cannot really provide good info on the stock interfaceappswhatever i get irritated with carrier software and extras that are pushed on me especially when ive bought a phone outright without a contract if you are not in love with the samsung extras and do not rely on warranties the folks at xdadevelopers have some very informative reading,positive

after making the switch from android to my windows phone nokia lumia   years ago i never really felt like i was missing much sure there were games and qol apps i was not getting to use any longer bit in the grand scheme of things it seemed miniscule fast forward  years and my windows phone is very near the brink of death rather than shell out  for a quality windows phone with mobile  i decided to switch back to not only android but googles nexus platform so i knew that i would be getting required monthly security fixes updates and the latest os i love this phone the power the design it was a fantastic choice and i hold no reservations about purchasing it,positive

simply put you cannot find any better smart phone it has  it is tiny sleek thin big screen real buttons cannot stand those touch screens and has the microsoft exchange server which means it receives the email easily and automatically no need to pull them  no need to erase them after a week one can define when to get work emails so lets say you can get work emails only between am to pm on weekdays after that you shall  you will have to actively pull them genius,positive
i love this phone it has  it is been almost  years and still using it the only thing i do not like about this phone is the camera during day light i capture excellent pictures but when there is not enough light or at night it has  it is so hard to capture a clear picture pictures taken in low light or at night times are mostly blurry you have to keep your hands still to capture a qood quality pictures sometimes i have to capture  times to take one good picture other than this im happy with the phone,positive

perfect as expected,positive
excellent product thank you very much ,positive
prior to buying i was not sure about the size it is basically the size of a gshock sports watchsoftware it is basically similar to nokia candy bar phones from around  there is a stylus built into the watch band that comes in handy as my big fingers would not be able to do much on the screen texting for most people this would not be a primary phone especially if you are a texter from my experience it is hard to switch between alpha and numeric because you end up having to scroll through a half dozen languages to get back around to alpha again bluetooth i successfully paired it with my car ford sync when it initially connects the car thinks it is in a call but that is easily cleared and worked fine from there somewhat successful with soundbeats universal hv which is a knock of of the lg it worked fine for handsfree which is the only real way to use this the speaker phone was not great i could not get the adp profile to work properly not  sure if that was an issue with the soundbeats or the watch but since the soundbeats streams audio fine from my samsung tab  i believe it is the watch mp player the software is very basic but functional i would have had to use the included earbuds since i could get the audio streaming to work over bluetooth succesfully read music from kingston  gb microsdhc class  flash memory card sdcgbetphone i use att and i had a smartphone that had the microsim i had to buy afunta nano sim adapter for iphone to convert it into a full size sim card it was a little tricky getting the sim into the phone using the adapter i probably spent a good  minutes i generally showed full bars call quality seemed decent i had a couple times when the audio was not great but i think that actually had to do with the other caller not this phonewatch the watch is accurate but it does reset when the battery is pulled probably the same if the battery fully diesthe screen blacks out unless you are using it so you have to touch a button to see the timebattery the battery is enough to make it at least a day and half on standby not sure about with excessive talking but that was with bluetooth turned onultimately i ended up returning it there were two factors that contributed the first was after cracking my screen on my smartphone i planned on dropping my data package to save month from the carrier i no more got the phone in and my carrier released new plans that covered data for the entire family talk for less that i was going to save by dropping just my data package so now there really is not a point in not having a smart phonei have a  tablet so i did not have to have a smart phone but it would have been hard for this to be a primary phone without something like that as i was using my tablet and google voice for texting which was the planif it was just the data plan issue i would have kept the watch phone simply for the mp player but since i cannot get the audio streaming to work reliably that is really what triggered me returning it instead of keeping itit was a cool little watch i work in it and it was cool little conversation starter i was so close to keeping it as a backup but just could not quite justify iti gave three starts because it was fun and i thought it was decent construction especially for the price my expectations were low based on other feedback but overall it worked but did have a few small issues that ended up being a deal breaker for me,neutral
works on tmobile but have to manually change from lte to g the bands are not right or something never got this to work on straighttalk so be warned its unlocked but may not be worth the hassle get the  for use on tmobile i wish i did,neutral

i loved the idea of having a smart watch ive been looking for one for a while and i was not willing to pay  for the samsung gear it did not come with any directions per say so you just have to wing it on operation use set up of course is touch screen it took me a little while to figure out that you can swipe through the main screens when you want to dial out the numbers are not  am not all that easy to push so you may find yourself having to redail the numbers a few times the volume is kind of low i wish it was louder so when driving i could hear the person clearer however ive been told that i can be heard just fine playing music is fine since it connects right through my phone it does not have a camera you cannot verbally write your text messages and i still have not completely figured out how to add numbers to the phone book all in all its actually a pretty good watch for the price play around with the watch for awhile you shall  you will eventually love it the inside of the band is completely rubber and i do not sweat which is good it looks exactly the same as it does in the pictures,neutral
buy it or the phone not the extras,neutral
buy it or the phone not the extras,neutral
my expectations were too high i guess while the phones work perfectly i was expecting the gear to come with the purchase,neutral
the phone works fine with my tmobile sim card and looks new however it is quite slow and im not sure if ive just grown used to the speed of the newer versions and sometimes the screen freezes,neutral
my husband got this phone and really liked it but he bent the charger cord and could no longer charge the phone so he got another phone,neutral
when it came it was still an att phone even though it was unlocked it would not work fully on my t mobile network rip off that should be in fine printwasted my money,neutral
this acquisition consists of  items that arrived separately the first was delivered quickly and in good condition the only detail was that there had installed the spanish language im from venezuela but it has  it is just a minor detail in this case it was a good experienceas the second item presents several problems such as that can only connect to wifi and not the local wireless internet network and the problem is more serious is that the battery is dead could not turn even once and i have found that is damaged the second acquisition was not at all satisfactory,neutral
this is really a nice phone with a great screen little software bloat decent camera for the price of the phone pretty good battery life  fast charging overall id rate it a very good valuethe reason im not giving it more stars is that it lacks a compass give me a break what would a magnetometer cost im talking about uses beyond a simply app with a compass rose walk out of a subway in an unfamiliar city with google maps of the city showing on your phone which direction should you be walking to get to your destination you could track yourself walking in one direction to see if you are tracking in the direction you want to goof course if the phone has a compass function google maps will display your orientation on the map so you instantly know which way to walk same with navigationmy cheapo lg sunset on tracfone has a compass so i expect one on all phones these days this one went back sigh,neutral
i installed a sd card in this phone but the memory in this phone is always filling up and the phone unexpectedly delets all your downloaded apps,neutral
this phone did not come with a instruction manual or sim card it has  it is a good phone but for the price it could at least come w instructions,neutral
i did not find options to use g it only gives option to use either g only which are wcdma or gsm so the internet is very slow when wifi is not availableother than this  the screen is good camera is ok a little bit slow anyway  should be good deal,neutral
i bought this samsung i omnia hd and so far i like it but no too much because it has some few issue to deal with and i guess its because it was not made to work with the usa network,neutral
i would have given this phone  stars if i was able to use it with cricket wireless apparently they did not know what they were doing because i took it to tmobile and within  minutes of walking through their doors they were able to get it to work i wound up switching to tmobile and getting a different phone that i fell in love with the samsung s edge long story short i could not get my money back because it did not meet the warranty requirements,neutral
i expected the camera quality to be better and a bit more memory i downloaded some apps and mysteiosly some of them has stopped working within two days of download,neutral
the phone itself is great and arrived when expected however the battery died and would not hold a charge within the first  weeks so i had to purchase another battery after i was able to find one,neutral

undoubtedly this is one of the best products on the market i already tried nokia lumia with windows os which was a complete frustration i already had a samsung galaxy mini tablet so i knew that i would like the galaxy phone as well the file manager in the android os is a real comfort just connect your device with usb cable to the computer and copy paste your files forget about the hassle of dealing with itune or similar approach of windows phonesbut why i give this a  star ranking unlike the samsung galaxy tablets the battery runs low rather quickly if the peripheral equipments such as camera music player   are used im used to listen to my musics by bluetooth headphones while exercising running or biking the bluetooth connection gets disrupted sounds going on and off frequently that means a poor bluetooth modulegps built in antenna has a poor performance while seating in the rear seats of the car it losses connection with the satellite frequently and some times the gps freezes up the speaker quality is very badhowever despite all these shortcomings still i could live with it and would recommend it nothing is perfect,neutral
update there was a recent ota update that improved the performance and addressed some of the issues i had with the phone the battery life seems better i can get through the day without fearing i am going to run out of juice phone seems a little snappier have not really noticed keyboard slow down latelycool feature to schedule shutdown and start of the phone had been addedstill have issue where music controls take few seconds to react i am using google music also if you take headphones off music keeps playing for few seconds and the bluetooth issue where it switches back to the phone still existsoverall though i am happier with the phone after the update i was pleasantly surprised and i will bump up the rating to  stars if there are more updates that improve the phone i will adjust rating accordinglyto address blu commentsi am using nova launcher and it alleviates some of the issues but accessing phone settings is really difficult still cannot find trusted devices option no launcher can change layouts of settings menuoriginal reviewi got this phone right when it came out it is my primary phone since then my previous phone was one plus one which i loved this phone i have really mixed feelings about the positive things  the screen is great storage is plenty micro sd slot good to have cpu is good enough for what i use it for finger sensor is pretty much flawless camera is passable when it works negatives  the ui is dismal at best even after i installed nova launcher a lot of settings are hidden and hard to find and some you cannot find at all trusted devices option for example the settings menu is on the bottom and is completely non stock android if this was only problem i could live with that ui is sluggish when i listen to music and i press stop music keeps playing for another  seconds bluetooth has been poor for me when i use headset and i call someone sometimes it switches from bt headset to phone for no reason and i have to switch it back manually even typing is super slow sometimes i have to wait  or  seconds after key press for something to appear camera is slow to start and if you have gestures enabled you will be taking pictures of your pocket a lot battery life is terrible sometimes completely drained after  or  hours i know this is not the fault of the phone but xda community is really small they got root but there are no alternative roms on the horizon the only thing that could save this phoneif this phone was closer to stock android and basic things just worked it would be my favorite phone for  you get great hardware but everything else is bad i had many phones nokian nhtc mytouch g lg l nexus  nexus moto x first and second gen one plus one nexus  i have never disliked a phone as much as i disliked this one probably because it promised so much but it totally failed to deliver if your main draw is the screen and media consumption this would be a good fit at everything else this phone falters,neutral
did not work well with net service,neutral
well  i had this phone for about  months now and at first the phone was great no straches just like new but after  months of having the phone my memory started to get full i could have only  pictures and it would get full so i could not take any photos or if i did i had to delete my current ones which been really annoying and i do not know if it has  it is the phone because it has  it is a used phone or if it has  it is metro pcs but im always getting drop calls and the phone freezes up   sometimes it takes forever to come up on after restarting it  the phone was a gb which that was my fault but over all i thought it would have thought it would had performed a lot better,neutral

i really wanted to like this phone for its camera quality the camera is good but i cannot live with it as a phone because tge symbian operating system is simply too limited there are not enough developers and apps to support really basic needs particularly things like google voice for using an alternate number which was the deal breaker for me,neutral

i got this phone about three weeks ago to replace my lg optimus t i liked the optimus t but felt it was a little laggy when running apps and the screen was smaller than i really wanted this phone initially seemed perfect bigger screen bigger memory better camera all of that is true and i really enjoy all of those aspects of the phonemy biggest complaint is the text messaging the phone out of box has some pretty bad texting problems that can be found across the tmobile board wish i had seen those earlier messages fail constantly some messages that fail have more than  characters other are short messages it took me five minutes to get an ok sent to one of my employees if this problem did not exist this phone would be a star for me but both samsung and tmobile support do not seem to want to do anything about this problem,neutral
as much as i like this phone there are a couple of issues i need to address the first thing i notice when i got the phone is that it was not factory sealed and it had been opened before not only that but after looking into the settings the system been modified because of this i do not get any new update what has  what is worse is that the phone crashes and then keeps rebooting over and over none of the recovery options work except for a factory reset even though it works after that the system is still modified this happened to me two times already i would watch out for this,neutral

do not get me wrong this is now a bad phone it has  it is just that there are blu phones with more features promised lollipop upgrades and cheaper price points out therethe premise for this phone is appreciated it shares the same snapper that is included in the new blu life one which is an older model camera but still takes great shots the unit has a  screen which is offset by a larger form factor which makes the device seem larger than competitors with like sized screens the screen looks great and shows colors well with no graininess the form factor is certainly comfortable in the hand due to the size however it is oddly rounded at top bottom and back of phone the power button is at top volume buttons on the left and a single camera shutter button on the right if you have owned blu devices before this is odd as generally the buttons all reside on the right side of the phone the charging port is angled and set to the far right of the bottom which makes for awkward placement when charging considering the price of the phone  one would expect there to be some pretty nice standout features ie tap to wake here of which there are nonenote the camera app has many great features as it should with a phone called selfiethere are other blu devices out currently that employ a fantastic  core mediatek processor and great camera blu life xl blu vivo air at a cheaper price this is just a very bland phone for the price you payi certainly would recommend this phone at a price similar to blus other flagshiplike devices,neutral

as someone who just wants a good small phone for making phone calls i found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone i could find the phone i replaced was a bar phone the size of a chicklets box every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flipphone garbageso i chose this phone entirely for its size not because it has  it is a smart phone keyboard way too small to type on and i was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth i do recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls but do not get your hopes uphaving said that you get what you pay for the pictures provided by the manufacturer are very misleading showing a standard android launcher screen when in fact this phone has a cheap custom ux that tries and fails to look like ios for no discernible reason this custom ui does not use android standards  for example  there is no apps tray and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not  it has a recent apps button but it has  it is inexplicably used for settings instead  recent apps is instead found only by holding down the home button the paltry user guide has no instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom ui so you are completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach recent apps so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens tap and hold on empty spot of launcher instead of using the perfectly fine android contacts app there has  there is a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired you cannot edit or delete contacts stored on your sim card but you can add new sim contacts  you shall  you will have to download sim contacts by penumbraapps from play store  the maximum volume on the handset is not loud enough the maximum volume on the speakerphone really really is not loud enough you cannot change lock screen background to pic  you are stuck with what they give you because of screen size keyboard is nearly impossible to type on  download touchpal which is a the best keyboard for android anyway b allows you to resize it i can type on this one status bar shows mobile  wifi signal strength but does not show bluetooth status again silly custom ui  however there is a power control widget you can put on the home screen for that the battery monitor is wildly inaccurate if you keep your phone numbers on your sim the direct dial widget thinks every phone number is a mobile phone and you cannot change it the accelerometer is sketchy  when pulling phone down from face during call screen comes on only about th of the time  worse power button does not start up the screen during calls about  of the time eitherif anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore i probably would not have even looked at this one but if you want a small phone with decent call quality you are pretty much stuck with this,neutral
received the phone after waiting  weeks when it was released was and super excited after it was on sale for  bucks i had to buy it there is a lot to talk about lol the phone has  sim cards slot  is for g and g signal while slot  is g next to the battery which you must removed to access dont forget the sd card slot battery life is great it lasts me to the end of the day just from texts videos and web the screen is awesome  inches p goodness i have big hands and it is still hard for my thumb to reach to the corner of the screen capacitive buttons to squeeze out more size i would assume volume buttons and the power button are located on the right side of the device headphone jack on top and charger port on the bottom weight on the phone is okay though it is not balanced very well there have been times where ive had the phone go over my index finger big hands the camera is okay mp with a led light to accompany it front camera is mp which i dont really care for unless youre a selfie person or for skype for pictures youll be using those filters to help the image quality lol the back speaker is a bit too loud in my opinion great phone for the price bloatfree i have rooted the device with kingo root now the bad stuff oh boybad the smartphone did not attempt to read my g sd card ive tried many cards on the device and nothing i asked for a replacement for the dead sd slot which came in to days woo grabbed the new replacement aaaaaand it did not work really frustrating since i have tons of music on those cards on both devices ive had the same problem the battery seems to be picky about what phone charger can and cant charge it what the while charging the top half of the huge screen becomes unresponsive bringing down the notification bar at the home screen is almost impossible while charging maybe its the voltage coming into the deviceso many bugs on the ui such as the swipe lock screen i touch the bubble swipe to the right and the it unlocks and locks immediately to access my home screen i must go through my notifications bar and menus menus menus another example the dial pad dialing numbers lags really bad im not sure if it is specific apps youtube etc or the wifi hardware but while watching p videos they seem to buffer too often making hd videos almost unwatchable it could be the  kitkat os that is contributing to  of these problems and hopefully they will be fixed with the  lollipop upgrade which the eta on that is unknown otherwise its a good starting phone with decent specs but if problems continue to arise i might will return this phone and spend  bucks more for a better upgrade i could bump to  stars if  lollipop comes in,neutral

the phone was beautiful coming out the box i brought the phone in gold it looks like and feels like a premium phone but that is where it stopspro  beautiful color feels and looks like premium phone  comes with case earbuds and screen protector  decent camera  battery charges quickly and last a little better than average smartphone  touch screen is responsive and moves smoothlycons  the volume is low and sounds tinny with or without earbuds which was a deal breaker for me i tried numerous earbuds with same result  case feels flimsy and there are very few cases listed on amazon that are appealing for this product  i do not think it has gorilla glass which is disappointing since the energy x has gorilla overall if this fits your budget it is still a decent enough phone if blu made improvements to the audio and added gorilla glass i would definitely say it would give premium phones a run for their money,neutral

it is a okay phone but cant do wat i did with my pantech link you get wat u pay for,neutral
while i love the phone several things have me wondering what i got  the phone does not look new and probably is not and it does not say anywhere that you are buying a brand new phone  when i opened the back cover there were some scratches on the underside of it and on the frame of the phone below the battery and minor abrasions close to the rear camera which is quite strange to see since i thought it was supposed to be new  the pins for the wireless charging on the back of the frame are indented to one side suggesting it was damaged or not set properly and i have yet to check that out when i eventually get a qi charger for it i at least do not have to buy a wireless sticker since it seems to have one already installed but i know they do not usually come with that and just the nfc sticker module and it does look like it was put on after so yay  the volume buttons are loose and shake everytime i touch them which although not a problem as yet has me wondering about the construction of the phonethat being said pictures are great internet speeds are awesome and pages load very quickly and it does have a lot of features and brilliant colours as well as a bright display lots of customization options and the original charger charges to full in about two hours when the battery was at  aftermarket battery replacements are available in higher ranges for longer use and back cover comes in various colours loads of storage on the the gb and the android  stock runs smooth wireless transfer on bluetooth and wifi is good and nfc functions as expected and most important it works as a phone with full bars where other phones drop to two and three bars i did notice however that the playback for videos can stretch to one side when played in portrait and skews the image when you turn the phone during playback which does get frustrating at times video is very clean and slow motion and ultra hd look very good but p at  frames works best from my experiments overall i would recommend the phone minus the little quirks i had with mine,neutral

the phone is light and has great battery life the screen is clean and easy to read and the buttons are great if you text a lot not like the samsung phone i replaced with this one the camera is as expected just a novelty do not expect to get good pics just mediocre i like the phone ok no real issues the thing is that i do not think for me it is worth the price i would rather pay a little more and have more functionality this phone is pretty basic and the price is not bad but again i am going to apply my refund to something with more features like touch screen and a larger screen really id like something i can download apps and have the great functionality of a nokia so gonna search for something that fits my need and my budget but for me this phone was not it,neutral

i received this smartphone in excellent condition i extensively reviewed it in various serious gsm smartphone review sites it needed to have mhz band wifi and gps so this one had all of it and more i received it in a retail box not a brown carton like some others which was fine once opened surprise the only mini manual is in chinese language i had to go to the lg website from australia to get the manual in english i charge it and waited put it in my minisim card and started it surprise it started in chinese no english counter part all chinese scriptures i had to figure through some trials and errors to put in in english so the australian manual helped quite a bit finally i got it started recognized my cell service provider ok so far so good when one reviews the apps one finds besides what was expected another surprise lots of chinese apps which meant nothing to me except most were for gambling online i had to go on settings and erase all of that junk from my phone it is now clean with my data service and rid of all those junk gambling apps i hope i easily loaded apps from google play such as skymaps maps was included and other apps i need for my work and hobbies so it has  it is ok here the same phone with contract goes for  so i am satisfied with my lg i have an older lg the gt which still works fine for the price and the capacity it is a fine purchase but please the seller must include an english manualuser guide and set the phone in english or multilanguage customers will appreciate that,neutral
i bought this to replace my wifes att s which was so bogged down by bloatware that the battery would not hold a charge for more than an hour the s mini has an amazing battery life by comparison and considerably less bloatware as no phone carrier has control of it my model was set up for the south african market and my wifes for the german with some guidance as to the settings they both work on the att network without problemhowever the h data connection is actually a tad slower than the ss g lte even with the sms significantly better processor and fewer programs in the background even the regular operating system is pokey,neutral

whilst i found that the phone had nice features i was having trouble connecting to the local network so one minute i can call and receive call but another time i cannot make calls and receive calls this would happen throughout the day i would have to constantly restart it to get it to function for about an hour this became very annoying quickly im not sure if it has  it is the phone itself or if there is a problem registering on the network,neutral
im writing this review from the perspective of an american who lives and travels overseas because of this i was looking for an unlocked quadband gsm phone that had g wifi gps a decent screen size for video and a good app selection plus i wanted this all at a reasonable price since i would not be getting any plan subsidy using this criteria the  seemed perfect and there are a lot of great things about this phone for the traveler which ill go into later the main negative i found was that the american version of this handset and the others in its product line do not support g outside of the americas the  american edition does not support the umts g  frequency wikipedia has an entry under list of umts networks that show which carriers use which frequency now the point can be made that i bought american edition and should not be surprised that it will not pick up g in other countries the only problem is that almost all of nokias other american version g handsets like the n x and e my wifes phonedo support the  frequency to be fair the  will support edge networks wherever you want to go and if you use a browser like opera mini you may not even notice that much of a difference in general web browsing it has  it is just something to consider if you are looking at this as an international travel phone and a fast data connection is important to younow the  does have some very nice features for the traveler that should be noted first and foremost is the ability to preinstall free ovi maps in your phone before you get on the plane this allows you to use the s gps with voice directions without an active data connection this is something that other free mapping services like google maps cannot do of course you could go with third party software like ndrive and pay up to  per map personally ill go with free of course with nokia there is usually a catch this one is that not every nokia handset that has a gps gets free ovi maps the  does but my wifes e a phone released the same year and is much more expensive than the  does not if you are looking at other other nokia phones and this feature is important to you then check make sure the phone can use free ovi mapsanother important travel feature is that the  has wifi if you spend time overseas you will probably be buying local prepaid sim cards the s quadband gsm capability lets you do that everywhere with no or expensive data service therefore wifi is essential find a free hot spot at a coffee shop and you can check your email tweet update your facebook and make skype calls back home the nokia catch here is that connecting with wifi can be a mysterious and confusing process you would think that once you hook up to a wifi connection then that the phone would automatically use that connection as the default we will you would be wrong the first thing you need to do is go into all your applications that go online and insure that the default connection is set to always ask that way you can select the connection you want the app to use if you do not then the  may or may not use the free wifi connection and instead drain the money out of your sim card without you noticingas for long train plane and automobile rides the  is a very decent media player it has a standard mm audio jack and the music playback is very good quality the screen is on the small side for video coming in at  inches but it is very high res at  by  and hence the video is sharp and clear the screen is also in  widescreen format that means that the black bar problem on widescreen movies is not so noticeable you will need to convert your videos to the mp format for the installed real player but you would want to do that anyway to bring the file size down nokia also provides a generous  gb micro sd card that can be upgraded to  gb that means that right out of the box you can put a lot of media on the phone without having to spend money on a bigger sd cardas for apps the  uses the sv software and the phone has been out long enough that there are a fair amount of apps for the phone you may have to dig for it but pretty much everything i want the  to do and i want it to do a quite a lot there is an app out there to let me do it the difference with apple and android is that you may have  flavors of apps to do the  task you want while with sv you will probably only have one the nokia catch here is that sv is a tough operating system to get to know and work with it is not intuitive and can be initially very frustrating but with time you get used to it has  it is quirks and there has  there is lots of support online in different forums to help you learn the ropesin the end i was looking for a phone that if i was traveling very light could do all the things a basic netbook could do despite it has  it is lack of g outside north and south america the  does meet those expectations with a small folding bluetooth keyboard the iphone will not let you do that yet and a battery backup charger get one that uses either aa or aaa batteries so you can keep replacing the batteriesi can watch movies listen to music write long emails or notes and play games for all of my long haul flights and layovers there is even an ebook app ereader that works pretty well if you bump the font up then when i finally do get to my destination i can fire up the gps and load a local sim card and im moving and communicating in no time all this for a reasonable price without a contractthere is no question that nokia delivers great hardware value with their handsets the challange for nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let us the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware with stores in the us selling  dollar gb iphone gss with a two year contract there is becoming less and less reason for folks to put up with nokias quirks,neutral
no scratches on the glass and worked nearly as described except the headphone jack is broken  which is a real bummer the apple store will only replace the phone for as much as i already paid for it or i have the option of fixing it myself which really is not what i want to do im too nervous about doing further damage inside i guess this is what i get for buying a used phone other than that it works perfectly and arrived quickly,neutral
i expected the camera quality to be better and a bit more memory i downloaded some apps and mysteiosly some of them has stopped working within two days of download,neutral
the actual cell phone is in perfect condition i absolutely love the size style color and general appearance i could not be more pleased however the screen has completely frozen up on me numerous times im not sure if this is typical of an unlocked  smartphone or not but i like the phone enough to deal with this issue hopefully this will not continue but time will tell great phone at a great price i would recommend this selleor as thus far they have been prompt courteous and honest,neutral

i wanted to give this  stars i really did it was so closepros simple no distractions phone i cannot just use apps and stuff to distract myself all day physical buttons so much better than all this touch screen only crap on smartphones these days the best interval timer app i have ever found on any phone ever builtin straightforward and straightforwardly customizable and perfect this little timer app made me want to give it  stars all by itself music player with  mm headset jack great customizable front screen opera browser so i can use the internet awkwardly if i really need to the fact that using the internet is inconvenient is actually a plus for me voice recorder basic tasks and task list straightforward functional alarm calendar camera video recorder calculator stopwatch radio and little notes appconsthis is where the amazing phones loses  whole stars the stereo audio does not work unless the headphones are left slightly unplugged at exactly the right spot otherwise it plays it mono for my usage this is a major flaw being left slightly unplugged means that a slight jostle will skip to the next track randomly so i cannot move and have stereo sound at the same time the button size and layout the layout moving the  buttons normally on the bottom over to the side is pretty annoying my muscle memory for t typing keeps getting confused but worse the layout change makes the button size is just too small to accurately type cannot customize the two shortcut buttons difficult to import or sync contacts from other mobile ecosystems like android or ios the ovi app store is dead it was bad but the opera store that replaced it is terrible and useless cannot minimize the browser but then again i do not want to be on the internet too much anyway so that has  that is not too badill be selling this one as soon as i can afford the nokia ,neutral

this phone is okbut no boomsound front facing speakers so the terribly places speaker grill will be covered by your pinky finger while holding with one hand which will muffle the already disappointingly low volume the volume sucks it has boomsound but only when done headphones are plugged in the screen is nice everything else is solid the camera is improved over the m but the m is overall a better phone this phone is ok if u want an android in an iphones body,neutral

everything was fine until after  months when it started to glitch then froze,neutral
i did not realize at the time of purchase that the phone had been giving people so many issues i have had it for a few months and have gotten questionable use out of it to say the least at the time of purchase it sounded like a good phone especially given that i cannot exactly afford the more expensive phones from samsung when i first got it the phone worked like a charm and was amazing however after having it a short while i began to have major issues with freezing when connected to the internet it becomes extremely slow and i often had to restart it by removing the battery i also found out later that the gb disk space your supposed to get is much closer to gb which fills up very quick contributing to the extensive lagging i cannot return the phone so i am going to get the most mileage i can out of it and try to keep it offline as much as possible it really is a shame that these issues make me dislike it as much as i do since it does have a very nice screen resolution two very nice cameras and great speaker and call quality it would make a great starter phone for your teen but if you are one who uses your phone a lot especially if it requires much internet i would say keep shopping,neutral
the phone is too small and prone to breakings,neutral

i returned it it has  it is fairly slow netflix is practically a slideshow unless you set your bandwidth to lowest quality and even then you get av sync issues the screen is fairly small compared to some of the other newer android devices out there the camera is low quality and the headphone output is extremely weak if you pipe it through your cars stereocall quality is quite good though i returned it and bought a used samsung exhibit ii g for the same price  even new the exhibit ii retails for only  more and is a much nicer and much faster phonei cannot see paying more than  for this phone new it would have been a great phone for  in  or  but it has  it is not worth the money when there are better phones for near the same price point,neutral
the front facing camera was broken,neutral
where to start i have tried to really really like this phone too many quirks with it though sent it back after a full  days of use i have owned  iphones and it is a challenge to start with a new operating system and new hardware features i am tech savvy putting several computers together and jailbreaking many phones for family and friends that being said i think i can make the jump to android i ultimately concluded this phone has some hardware issuesit has turned on in my pocket a few times big issue and i did not have the motion gestures on the phone screen stays on if someone calls you while currently on the phone speaking moving it from face and back again did not seem to help screen staying on makes the phone very hot which will result in a shorter life span of the phone the battery drains faster than most phones it has a strange issue when it rapidly goes down to  with the upgrade to  it now goes rapidly to  and then still drains fastagreed the screen is beautiful the sound quality is nice ear speaker and external speaker are loud enough it is responsive and has the correct cpu and ram combination i do not like the speaker placement or the phone sleep buttoni am going to use my old iphone s till the new nexus  comes out will try android once again i really want a larger screen apple waited too long for this sucks my wife has claimed my iphone  now i digress,neutral

fast shipping as described however it stopped working after  months will not stay charged replacing battery does not fix it,neutral
it works just for simple use because the problemm is that it doesnt have enough cache memory to save the most of my common applications it works ok with g,neutral
my only gripe is that the storage space is so small that i cannot even download the software updates i have nothing on the phone yet but the next android update cannot download oh well all i use it for is games and chromecast casting anyways,neutral
used it for  days then it became problematic charging the phone have to hold the cable a certain way to charge the phone the usb port on the phone and the usb cable supplied is very cheap but otherwise it is a decent phone if you do not need to play games on it beware battery life is lacking,neutral
the device appears to be an oem item but is made in china as opposed to the original which is made in malaysia as i recall it does have the otter box logo on the clip interestingly the date code stamped on the inside is identical to the oem that came with the original product odd that it would have the same date code as one made in another country i mention all this because the new one fits pretty well but not perfectly the phone hangs up in the holster as it is being removed it seems secure enough when in the holster given other choices i would probably opt for am oem unit from the manufacturer if available we will see how this holds up over time,neutral
the phone it not even gb very slow but the price good so i learn my mistake no more again,neutral
service is good but the commodity quality is not okey perhaps it is accacident,neutral
is ok but few apps are not working especially out of usa,neutral
lg g my favorite phone as well as my notso favorite phone at times i guess i will clear up what i mean by that before that i just have to say that for a former flagship this holds its place well gb ram  pixels per inch quad hd display k at fps specs like these are just coming about in new phones today if you are the sort of person who keeps up with the latest flagships most phones today are already above and beyond these specs so this is not where you should get the best of the best however the price of this phone is lower than most former flagships so it is an easy grab i bought this at  when the g was already out but as of august  the price is around  that is probably because lg has released the g v and v will unveil on september th or will already have been released for those people in the future reading this now to the phone itselfprosclear screen now i know this is not a full k display but again i do not think you are coming to buy a movie projector anyway i love the quality of the screen while most phones of  can watch youtube videos in p this phone can watch one step above in pif the video supports thatcamera mp is pretty typical as of  but this does take amazing photos from the back camera the clarity is really nice and it is not blurry ever the focus is also pretty good and you can get the blurred effect if you use the magic focus mode correctlymemory i bought the gb model so i would have room for things and after a year i still have gb of free space i would say i am a decently heavy phone user so i do have a lot of stuff on my phone but it supports up to gb on a microsd card so my gb card is also the cause for my free space it is a pretty responsive phone so there is not much to worry about on loading timeram gb of ram is a must nowadays ram is basically memory to help the phone to do tasks without having to shut them down to open another one i have yet to see myself using all gb of ram so pretty happy about thatconsbattery it does have a mah battery but that does not work to extend it for much longer lg focused on its screen a lot so the screen sucks the battery life out of this phone like crazy it can last a day with decent usage but heavy users might want to bring the charger or extra battery since it is removableshutdowns now i am not sure why this happens to my phone and it made me question whether this phone was actually new if i do not use my phone for a certain amount of timeit varies the phone will sometimes just shut off and i have to power it back on it is not like it tells me it is turning off either it just is a black screen and when i press the power button it will bring me to the lg symbol powering it on i hope i find a way to fix that since i have had the issue since i have gotten the phone it is not everyday but it is somewhat often and kind of annoying i have no intention to just buy a new phone but if amazon or some other contest gives a brand new lg g or v i would not mind taking that now heat the phone does heat up kinda often and you do not even have to be doing anything sometimes i just turn on the phone and leave it in my pocket and it is super hot and i feel it through my pocket this also made me question whether this phone is new but i guess ill just live with it if you are heavy on gaming sometimes parts of the screen get hotusually its by the volume buttons so touching the screen will be a hassle too the seller gave me a screen protector when i did not know i would get one so that has  that is where i question how new this phone is when i got it i actually did not even know i had a protector until the bubbles came upvibration i think my phone lost its ability to vibrate recently and i do not understand how or why eitheri do not think all of you will have the same issues that i had if you get this phone new,neutral

the phone is great for the price  good camera relatively quick specs the  megapixel camera on it is extremely snappy and responsive and having a replaceable battery truly is a plus i thought at first what a great buy  a relatively spec packed budget friendly device however im not sure if this specific model was defective that i received but a week into using the device i continued to receive errors about the sim card i would frequently have to restart the device to get the sim card to work even had to take it output it back in to get the sim card to register with the phone the issue was in fact not the sim card because i put it in my old lg phoenix  and it worked just fine i think my device had a defective sim slot  but the next issue is that the phone deleted all of my data from my sd card randomly this was very upsetting to me because there were many files and photos i have not backed up so now they are forever lost at that point i went through with returning the device to amazon and receiving my money back also switched back to my lg phoenix for the price  it is an okay phone the advertisements are just on the lock screen which is not really of an annoyance the screen is bright crisp the phone is an okay buy  but beware of possible defects and software glitches always make sure you back up your files it has  it is still very upsetting that this device somehow erased all of my sd card data randomly one day when i went to get to my music and every single thing was gone that was the bottom line for me  there is obviously some glitches that need to be worked out here i believe with time more people will realize that this device has some caveats that need to be worked out,neutral

so i bought this phone last november and except for the fact that the corners of the screen sometimes jump it is a beautiful phone however every time it is restarted since i bought it it took hours to get pass a bootloader page which only keeps you going around in circles im not verse in technology and software problems and i have tried to source a solution online without success in the past after trying for hours the phone would finally come on however three days ago i restarted it and it has not come on since then i have done everything in my power to get it pass the bootloader page to no avail i am open to advice on the matter thank you,neutral

its small so easy to fit in a purse or in your pockets i can listen to the radio and save my favorite stations the only things i would say is a little problem is that you can only receive  mb as pictures goes nothing over that number would not be able to download and you also have to resize picture that you have taken to send to individual you cannot text while in a conversation with someone or surf the net kinda weird but that has  that is how the phone operate oh yeah and you would have to delete text that someone sent along the way since the memory is very little for the phone,neutral

after  months of daily usage i believe i have a relatively complete picture of what i got and hence would like to provide some opinion to whoever are interestedpros solid build quality it did fall on the hardwoodconcrete floor a couple of times and no damage or dent was left on the phone good picture quality although the software windows phone  sometimes refuse to switch the scene modes the picture quality is pretty good at various light conditions nice display what you can expect from a amoled  vivid color good resolution dark dark i confirm the phone work well with any local wireless network home network company network even hotspots from other cellphones the phone also works with g cellular signals i am not sure whether it is lte but i can watch youtube video without freezingcons i am using this phone with tmobile i confirm i can not send any text messages i can receive text messages though it is still annoying sometimes when the tmobile signal is not g the cellphone shows h which i believe means hspag i cannot connect to internet from my cellphone battery life is relatively short even i do not use it much for browsing internet signal it could run out of juice at the end of the dayall in all if you do not travel a lot and always have good local wireless connection this phone is worth the price if you do travel it feels awkward when you cannot use the cellular signal to connect to the internet especially when you need it,neutral

right off the bat i was attracted to the design and thinness of the phone it feels like it is well built and has quality material i was very skeptical about the quality of the phone based on the price being so cheap but this blu vivo air lte had to replace my iphone  when i dropped itwhat i did not likewhen using the phone it would randomly freeze or restart which is very annoying if you are playing games texting watching videos or even trading stock or forex sometime it would freeze and not even the power button would make the phone turn off there is a glitch every now and then where i have to click the screen  to  times for the phone to process what i just did im not sure if this is  the phone but i have never had any problem with gps until i used this phone  of the time it could not locate exactly where i am if i put in an address it would not be able to pinpoint my exact location and it caused a lot of stresswhat i did likethe picture quality is awesome i love watching videos on my phone after half a year my battery life is getting better and better the size of the phone is excellent not too big not too small the thin profile made people go wow i got a lot of compliments some said it looked like an iphonea big plus is the toughness of the screen i dropped a lbs weight on the screen but the phone slightly bent instead of smashing and obliterating the phone i could not believe it survived overall this would be a great temporary phone have no longer then  months unless you cannot afford another one,neutral

i had to replace my samsung phone because i dropped it in a comet filled toilet while cleaning i ordered this phone because it did not have a bunch of apps on the front which confuse me so it showed up in  days packaged very well i looked for the manual in the box and it was not there ok im mad now i went to have it activated and that went smoothly she said it looked pretty easy to understand and not to worry about the manual i went home and tried to figure things out and could not find the speaker phone button on the outside of the phone that has  that is where it has  it is supposed to be right well you have to open the phone where the keyboard is and push speaker phone but you cannot use speaker while the phone is closed i do not like that feature at all also the screen on the front of the phone is pretty small which makes it more difficult it has  it is been a couple of weeks and i still am having trouble with the phone trying to figure out things that should be easy to figure out id really like to have my old phone back i am not happy about this purchase,neutral

the phone dose everything the add says it has  it is really like having a small computer im a att customer i was really worried about it running slow on g but it woks great do not buy in to the hipe on the glass screen it will brake very easy the biggest down fall is you cannot buy a good case the first time i dropped it the phone landed on the bottom of the phone stright up just at it looks in the amazon picture my first though was thank goodness it did not land on the glass but it was cracked top to bottom cracked everywhere i did alot of research on the glass and was shocked to see it brake so easy this phone is heavy,neutral
when i bought the xperia sp i spent a lot of time on the net especially on  searching for the pros and the cons about this phoneat first sight it was the perfect phone for me very nice phone and the design is omg it has  it is not too heavy and it has  it is the right size for me xperia z is too large with its  i like the light effect at the bottom while receiving a call charging listening to music or watching pictures but while using it it was all different it discharges faster even if nothing is runningworst it has  it is freezing all the time sometimes it even reboot itself because the apps running are too busy and i cannot do nothing than letting it work by itselfi think sony can do better,neutral
although i could not get this headet to pair with my device i must say that i am mighty impressed and pleased with the quality and level of excellent customer service and feedback received from vendor they provided assistance in helping me to pair the headset and when all attempts failed i promptly received a refund,neutral
we got this phone to work with the bring your own phone plan with straight talk even though straight talk service generally runs off the verizon towers this phone still connects through the att tower which has horrible service where we live and are never able to get the data to work as a result the background noise cancelling technology in the microphone cancels out our voices in addition to the background noise and people have a very hard time hearing us unless we have the call on speakerphone and sometimes that does not even work we love the look of the phone and it runs well but it is a pain that it will not transfer over to the verizon towers and it has  it is getting really old that we have to make all our calls on speakerphone andthe apps are limited fix the microphone issues and expand the app store and this would be a killer phone,neutral
easy to use and it is very light texting and all medias it has  it is perfect and fast the only thing is the camera i read before i placed my order somebody said that the camera was very clean and perfect even being only pm but this is no true the camera is very blare and the pictures quality is not good and also the videos but the rest it is very fair i think that for the  i paid is so so,neutral
i love the phone its just way too big to be used as a phone more like a tablet,neutral
good except the fact that i cannot share internet with this phone outside the usit would have been good to know before i bought it,neutral
the basics of purchasing something is getting what you ask for i ordered a black phone but instead got a white phone the product itself is good but for a company to make a mistake like this is just plain scary main reason for purchasing is for the dual sims and i am loving that so far device quickly was updated to  it runs well but gets hot at some weird times i dont mean warm i mean you cant miss the fact that it is hot i have had two instances when i look at it and it is off these have been registered as system incidents was reading up on these incidents and i am a bit concerned these situations are different from from restarts that i have triggered be squeezing the door outside the dual sim area i assume that when i squeeze there i move the sim underneath and this triggers a restart i can live with that because my sims were cut screen is lovely its loud enough so i dont miss calls camera is good it switches between apps effortlessly and well its a good phoneso far,neutral
it looks new and there is no problem said online such as purple screen in other iphone  however the screen is a bit slow,neutral
i bought this phone in hopes of something like super great it has  it is not bad its actually in really good condition since i bought it used but the battery life on this is extremely crappy if i charge it overnight to  and use it again once i wake up it shall  it will be  within  minutes of usage also charging this phone is a hassle as well since it takes forever to charge,neutral
it has  it is a great smartphone except for the tinny voice quality my main complaint is that i was sold a dual sim phone but the nd sim card slot is missing the card reader i noticed the plastic cover over the nd sim slot and just assumed it was just a protective piece while not in use after reading another review about not being dual sim i took off the cover and realized it cannot hold any sim technically this phone is dual sim capable but not really dual sim as advertised since ive already set up my phone  apps i do not really want to return this but since i paid for a dual sim but only have use of one i really should get my money backi did insert my uk sim card after using my att and immediately received several old texts so at least i know this phone will work in europe,neutral
hi the phone is nice  but it missing onething the cover where to put the sim card do not have ion it please send me the part cuz the sim can be lose,neutral

cannot seem to get the phone to play sound fortunately i have bluetooth headphones,neutral
seems like a nice device but the sound quality is bad worse than the  year old phone i replaced unless i talk at the tiny mic opening at the bottom of the phone the people at the other end of the call cannot understand what i am saying the clear case may partly cause this problem  or not i put a tracfone gsm sim card in  that was a mess but eventually got straightened out  i hope do not know if i will be able to access the web via att  so far i have only used my wifi which works perfectly im obviously not a techie so using this unlocked phone was a challenge i hope i can figure out the sound quality issue  since i bought it to use it primarily as a phone,neutral
i would give it a  but my numbers are off due to the sensor,neutral
does not do what i expexted it to with my iphone but its ok,neutral
phone itself is pretty fast but you get short battery life leftover images from previous apps and sometimes it gets to be a bit slow when you have multiple apps running in the background otherwise it has a pretty loud speaker fairly bright screen and decent size memory definitely better than a windows phone so  out of  stars seems right hopefully lollipop comes out soon for this phone,neutral

ive bought several blu phones over the last  years and overall i think they are a great buy for the moneyi returned a vivo xl before buying this as there were many issues i did not like with that phone i did a review on that one alsostarting off with this one seemed very familiar with my previous life xlheres my negatives so far after a month and a half notifications again most of my app notifications do not sound they worked for a while now most do notdo not know if it has  it is me or the phone i some cases i will set a tone and after hitting ok it will reset to none incoming calls there is supposed to be a drop down dismissanswer box to handle the callmost of the time it does not show up or if it has  it is hidden i do not know how to open it really frustrating still do not know if connecting lte no icon i can see im assuming it does there are only  pages available for apps not a big negative for me as the app icon at the bottom is now back missing on the vivo xl i also had trouble connecting to windows to get pictures off same with vivo xl found solutions online should be simple plug in featureplusesi did find a gb card that workedsandisc my vivo would not accept any brandthe back is easy to remove as they have put a notch back in it vivo did not have and was near impossible to get off only place was to use the charg port edge to pry off,neutral
phone is good but the charger has wired buzzing sound once plugged in i ended up using a different charger that i have around the house i bought it for my daughter she really does not need a smart phone to distract her so this simple one should do the job for calling and texting,neutral

ive only had this phone for a few days but i really like it it has  it is a very nice looking phone lightweight and a clear bright screen in addition to the usual charger data cable and headphones it came boxed with a screen protector and silicone case i really love the choice of colors and the price was acceptablei purchased this when my samsung galaxy skyrocket started freezing several times a day after only a year samsung is my brand of choice so to go with an unknown brand called blu was a real gamblemy only problem with the phone had to do with being unable to access my att data package when wifi was unavailable two lengthy calls to atts tech support and a visit to the store were not helpful the store staff said they had never heard of blu and suggested that i needed to return the phone to amazonmy last resort was to search online to see if others had the same issue i found several postings that provided the apn settings for my service provider i tried them and wow im now up and running so now the wait to see how things go with my pink blu life play has begun ill update this review as needed but for now im giving it four starsupdate  discovered that pictures sent via email would not download did another search online and found others who provided settings that worked callers notified me that my voice mail was not personalized will try to find a solution and report back even with these issues i still like this phoneupdate  i still like this phone and it is working fine i figured out how to record my personal voice mail greeting since my last update my only complaint right now is that the wlan does not automatically stay onupdate  i still like the phone but a little less the internal phone storage is small and will not accommodate many of my apps although i have a nice sized sd card the phone requires many of my apps to be stored internally and will not go on the sd card when my apps are updated i constantly get an insufficient storage space message setting the phone to automatically download to the sd card will not workperhaps all phones have this issue so my  star rating remains the blu tech people were very helpful in explaining my problemi may need to consider another phone when time for my att upgrade but this will make me unhappy i think the blu phones are a great alternative to the pricier name brand phonesupdate  having major problems with the updating of apps the phone prompts me that my apps need to be updated when i click on update i keep getting error messages saying there is insufficient space on the device for each application the majority of these apps are actually on the  sd card so im not sure what is happening for those apps i really want to be updated i end up deleting other apps to try to clear spaceit has  it is become a nuisance so when my att upgrade is available in the next couple of months i will be getting a different phone i am disappointed because i really loved this phone perhaps it has  it is just my particular phone or me i still think this is a good buy for someone who does not use this phone as their lifeline or need a lot of applications for the reason stated above i have lowered my rating to three stars,neutral

so the phone itself works just fine with our straight talk service previously used the blu life play  and that was a good phone til i shattered the screen i chose the blu energy x plus because of the battery life screen size android version and the camera well everything is great with the exception of the camera lots of pictures come out fuzzy because you cannot focus the camera on an object like you can with the life play  while it has  it is not an awful camera it has  it is not great either hopefully blu reads these reviews  makes a couple changes to their product otherwise great phone  we will buy blu again,neutral
decent midlevel phone for my teenage son battery life is mediocre at best,neutral
very clearly a previously used phone came in an opened box with a proprietary charger not microusb as this phone requires and nothing else the battery was definitely not new and had several scratches on it not the end of the world hey it only cost  but just be aware that you are buying a previously used phone and it might not work correctly,neutral
does most of what i thought,neutral
as someone who just wants a good small phone for making phone calls i found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone i could find the phone i replaced was a bar phone the size of a chicklets box every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flipphone garbageso i chose this phone entirely for its size not because it has  it is a smart phone keyboard way too small to type on and i was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth i do recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls but do not get your hopes uphaving said that you get what you pay for the pictures provided by the manufacturer are very misleading showing a standard android launcher screen when in fact this phone has a cheap custom ux that tries and fails to look like ios for no discernible reason this custom ui does not use android standards  for example  there is no apps tray and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not  it has a recent apps button but it has  it is inexplicably used for settings instead  recent apps is instead found only by holding down the home button the paltry user guide has no instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom ui so you are completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach recent apps so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens tap and hold on empty spot of launcher instead of using the perfectly fine android contacts app there has  there is a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired you cannot edit or delete contacts stored on your sim card but you can add new sim contacts  you shall  you will have to download sim contacts by penumbraapps from play store  the maximum volume on the handset is not loud enough the maximum volume on the speakerphone really really is not loud enough you cannot change lock screen background to pic  you are stuck with what they give you because of screen size keyboard is nearly impossible to type on  download touchpal which is a the best keyboard for android anyway b allows you to resize it i can type on this one status bar shows mobile  wifi signal strength but does not show bluetooth status again silly custom ui  however there is a power control widget you can put on the home screen for that the battery monitor is wildly inaccurate if you keep your phone numbers on your sim the direct dial widget thinks every phone number is a mobile phone and you cannot change it the accelerometer is sketchy  when pulling phone down from face during call screen comes on only about th of the time  worse power button does not start up the screen during calls about  of the time eitherif anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore i probably would not have even looked at this one but if you want a small phone with decent call quality you are pretty much stuck with this,neutral
the case does not seal very good along the bottom edge by the charging port there is a rainbow like sheen under part of the plastic protective cover,neutral
while my galaxy s edge order was in transit i asked this seller wireless place andor technomaster not sure what the name story is there whether this shipped with a usa ac outlet power adapter  flat prongs or the international adapter  round prongs spaced further apart they promptly replied that it ships with the latterinternational and added that they had  they would send me a usa adapter for free it arrived  days after the phone arrived nicebut i found that i was not getting samsungs quick charge feature which touts fast battery charging  in  min quick charge  yes i did have settings  fast cable charging enabled and no there was no fast charging xx popup message when connecting to ac power the phone was only estimating and achieving only about  charge increase per  minutes i messaged this seller and told of the problem to which they repliedthis is very normal that the last  or so takes a longer time to charge the phone takes around  to  hours to charge and that is normal mine does exactly the same thing i suggest you do a hard reset but i am sure if you get another s that is the same you will get the same result thanksid already researched this common s problem and resolved it it turned out the samsung adaptive fast charging usa power adapter this seller sent me for free was fakecounterfeit it did work to charge at normal slow speed but did not work for the quick charge  feature despite having all the right markings the fake was noticeably lighter weight different shape the text color was darker and the specs side of it was quite different compared to the genuine international version samsung ac adapter which came with the sresolution was my buying a simple internationaltousa ac power outlet adapter and using it with the genuine samsung adaptive fast charging adapter which came with the phone with its included usb cableso this seller did deliver exactly what i ordered a genuine galaxy s edge with genuine samsung adaptive fast charging adapter  usb cable all on time so no grievance there and i can give them the benefit of the doubt as not knowing that the usa ac adapter they sent me for free abovebeyond the call of duty was in fact fakecounterfeit where they disappointed was in their reply to my followup query about quick charge not working telling me only that the slow charging rate about  mins per  increase i was getting was normalproper meanwhile their own s edge product page touts the standard quick charge  feature i did reply to this seller explaining the fake samsung usa adapter problem and my resolution including the pic attachments here but i heard no further reply from them so no harm no foul with this seller but if i had not done my own research and resolved the quick charge problem id be living with slow charging only,neutral
i was not looking to spend lot on a cell phone as there is always a better one available in every month everything be it processor or ram are increasing and so are the applications size so i narrowed down to the basic features of a smart phone calling browsing music gps photosvideos voip etc blue life pure was a good dealpros perfect shape and design decent voice quality elegant looks holds lightcons screen could have been better i doubt there is not stereo speaker as well camera is poor in low light,neutral
great phone but i tried it with att an it did not work had  get another phone instead,neutral
cheap plastics user interface not very reactive just what i expected from a very cheap smartphoneexcept ships fulloptional it comes with a screen protector a flexible semitransparent case power brick earplugs which also work as fm antennaalso its one of the smallest smartphones you can buy nowadays ignoring the sub toys you can find on amazon and certainly the cheapestonly real complaint ie something below what i was expecting is that i ordered the black version and they sent me a white phone it was for my wife and she said she was okay with white so i didnt return it,neutral
the quality of sound is a little poor even worse with both sum card in it,neutral
actually i like the phone the instruction book you need a magnifying glass to read even with glasses the print is just very small i went online and printed the book from there there are no outlets that carry a case for the phone so i ordered from an amazon seller and found what they said was a blu cover for a dash jr it looked like it but it was not what it looked like back to the phone i am still learning it and am enjoying it carol,neutral
so first of all the package was fishy it was in a plastic bag not even a new that we put our lunch in then the box was there after having suspicion that the phone might not be new i started the phone and everything worked fine until i uploaded photos from dropbox and my old iphone it crashed the screen would not open i pressed the main button i pressed the one on the side i even tried to charge it but no luck it just stuck there even though i could see the led notification light so i had to take the battery out and put it again i mean i would accept if the same thing happened after a year but only after a week of purchasing new phone unacceptable shame i really wanted you like this phone it is a great phone photos applications and so many features that i like so much im giving it back and maybe find new completely new phone,neutral

i am trying to be fair about this review because this product has such a low price point i bought this watch to use at work while servicing in the field i thought it would be nice to get phone calls and texts to the phone so i did not miss any i will say it syncs with bluetooth and can receive calls no problem but the software with which you need to install to receive notifications is a battery drainer on my phone also it does not work push notifications almost always fails for any application on my phoneit does tell time though but i can think of many other watches for  that can do that too save your money and get something a little nicer i gave mine to my  yr old he loves it,neutral

the phone works well for a chap phone but the thing that ticks me off are the ads they will assess you another  if you turn them off and theya re constant i anticipated this price as a bonus for being a prime member not as a way for them to cram ads down my throatvery disappointedand customer service was less than helpful also this phone has very limited ring tones and it is difficult to download and implement outside ringtones though possible it also does not appear that you can set separate ring tones for different callers,neutral

i love the phone but unfortunately i had to return it because it would not work on the tmobile network tmobile is doing this obnoxious tihng where you now have to buy the tmobile only phone,neutral
very nice phone except for a major problem with dual sim operation the reason for a dual sim phone is for the purpose of staying connect in a fast paced world this phone does not allow you to have mobile data available when both sims are active it simply shuts off when both sims are selected between tmobile and samsung the problem could not be resolved the answer was just have one sim active and mobile data will work wrong reason for me when i have  asus phones working perfectly fine with dual sim operation on tmobile very very disappointed,neutral
has no sim setting i cannot find any signal,neutral

the previous one lasted four years in a commercial environment before it started to leak oil would prefer another brand but to do so would mean more holes in my door so i settled for an identical replacement simply so the existing holes could be used item looks nice but the made in china tag tells me not to expect a long life out of this one either,neutral

the rating reflects the balance between value and performance this phone is cheap   of the cost of a top end smartphone but performance is poor  you get what you pay forthe plus points  it has  it is cheap  it runs on wifi  this is a huge plus as you do not need to pay for phone network data set updates and data delivery to wifi only  it has a keyboard  touchscreen input on cheap phones with small screens is a nightmare  it works fine on skype and with rear camera allowing video calls  and this combines with the use of wifi giving freelow cost calls anywhere you can get wifi  screen is good  email easy to set up  slot for micro sd  small trackpad at bottom of phone very useful for highlighting and selecting web options  avoids the issue of hitting the wrong option with a finger on a tiny screenthe minus points insufficient internal phone memory  load skype and update to play store and that has  that is about it out of memory this is the major problem with the phone why did motorola not add more memory usually will not run videos  probably related to above no uma  if mobile network coverage is poor some phones can route calls through wifi very useful if you live in a poor coverage area this phone cannot do it associated motorola pc software randomly consumes huge amounts of cpu time even when the phone is not connected do not bother installing lots of att bloatware that consumes what little memory there is and usually is expensive to use no flash on the camerapart of the solution to the memory problem which is the real downside to this phone is to root the phone and then delete the bloatware and move the applications to the sd card but it has  it is not as easy as it seems rooting goes ok but applications will not always move and there has  there is not much memory there anyway and with rooting you risk bricking the phone yet to be tried is partitioning the sd card to act as phone memory if this works it should solve the memory issue but we will see ill post an updateoverall  if you want a lowcost smartphone with easy data input the keyboard access to email free wifibased surfing and skype this is for you but do not expect to be able to download many apps or be able to play much if anythingin the way of streamed video,neutral

i like the look of this phone and it functions well enough in terms of calling and texting though it does not automatically capitalize is or add apostrophes to words like doesnt but the internet is so incredibly slow that i never end up using it i used to have a samsung gravity smart and the internet under the same provider was so much faster i cannot even use this phone to look up directions when im lost in short i like it enough to keep it but i kind of wish i had stuck with droidsamsung,neutral

i have had it for  months now it definitely is a great phone but does have some shortfalls the phone is well built and although made of plastic does feel like a very good solid build  almost as solid as an iphone without the weight screen is good although i tend to keep my brightness at  to get a comparable display to my iphone the colors are not as luch as my iphone  a tad washed out but after a while you dont even notice the sound of the external speakers is amazing i love it the sound of the phone with headphonesearphones both good quality and the ones it came with it is good  but very low  no matter what app i use to watch videoshear music i find it to be a little low for my taste the vanilla os is awesome but after installing just a few apps and  months use the phone now feels very sluggish and and slow i find myself constantly having to clean my ram etc for the price point its ok i think it should cost a little lower considering other phones out there in the under  range which easily outperform this device my true love and reason for buying this phone is the thickness and feel of it besides that didnt fine much special about it also my phone appeard to be a repack as the box was not sealed and my headphones were defective i called alcatel support for an exchange on the headphones and they were very nice and said they will simply send me out a new pair that was two months ago i never got anything i still have to call them again sux i have to chase them down for something i purchased supposedly brand new the  stars however are for the phone and have nothing to do with the headphoneused phone experience,neutral

prosthis wannabe has a great color scheme i bought the bronze easy to use interface and a load of built in apps it even has an antilost app that the name brand do not but should if your phone strays too far from the watch ie someone is stealing it it will tell you that your phone is leaving the range of the bt notification app this in my opinion should be a staple of any smart watch especially at those exorbitant prices you can expand the internal memory with an micro sd card and even insert your sim card if you want to leave your phone behind or tucked away in the locker at your local gym without using the bluetooth again staples that should come with the expensive guys that do not it has a decent speaker and builtin mic it also has a built in camera which is not typically common place for smart watches and personally something that i can see becoming a privacy issue in gyms for being on a watch i find this a useless itemconslet us get into the nitty gritty that most video reviews overlook or simply try to play down shall we this is for all intents and purposes a clone knockoff of the samsung gear s there has  there is no mistaking that as such it does lack in a few areas the screen is a lcdtft display which means lower resolution compared to the lgs ips or samsungasuss amoled displays it has  it is decent but reminiscent of displays found on those  budget digital cameraswhile it ports over any sound including custom sounds that your phone has set the volume lacks control it has  it is either on or off i found it odd that the antitheft will vibrate when set as such but when the volume is turned off on the watch or down to vibrate mode on your phone it does not vibrate in silent mode you would not know when a text message comes through unless you caught the watch wakingup out of the corner of your eye or have the audio on not very advantageous in the work placeit also lacks an accelerometer such as the asus so you can just tilt it toward you to get it to wakeup out of sleep mode you have to manually press the power button to accomplish this the construction is entirely made out of abs plastic there are no aluminum parts even though it appears that waythe biggest of all offenses is the link from the qr code which is supposed to allow for the downloading of the btnotification apk this is essential in order for you to received texts andor email notification to your watch otherwise it has  it is just an overpriced bluetooth device the link given is unresponsive the webpage never finishes loading i have tried pasting it in several web browsers from my phone to every known type of portable and nonportable pctabletcomputer sources and this website is a dead link it stalls and timesout which tends to mean that it has  it is a dead site i found a youtube video by a guy who downloaded a btnotificaton apk from google play for his u smart watch another clone which worked for mine but we should not have to resort to this i have a samsung galaxy s activenow in all fairness i did do my research so i knew it was not a name brand designed for the us market per say as it runs on a proprietary os unlike ios and google wear however there should be staples in this arena that are part of any smart watch it has  it is definitely apparent that this market still requires standardizations to some extent i really want to score it higher but in all fairness i believe the pricepoint is still too steep for a device that lacks proper construction support and design it should be priced at  or lower,neutral

there are many good reviews and a few bad so i decided to weigh the odds and purchase the phone was in good cosmetic condition upon arrivalupon startup the default language was french this was an alarm as i had noted from another reviewer that the local samsung repair center caribbean would not service these as they are from another zoneworse the receiver speaker was not working after some digging around i realised that there was a bad connection at the speaker which would work if the speaker was pressed firmly against the case this appeared to be an uncommon problem globally and i contemplated contacting the supplier for action but realised that cost of return within warranty period may exceed the cost of the unit since i reside in the caribbeani decided to forego the warranty and dismantled the phone and confirmed my speaker was faulty i was able to pad the space between the speaker and the case and reassemble it works fine nowthis is the risk that caribbean shoppers take when purchasing directly from the usa but it usually is still cost beneficial perhaps i just got a bad apple from the orchard,neutral

this battery pack warms up the phone quite a bit the temperature feels like you constantly having it charging it did not really bother me but you will notice some heat at the back constantly it added some weight to the phone but not too bad i think i have better grip with the phone due to the thickness and weight i actually prefer this way you are unable to charge the battery pack by plugging the cable to the phone you can only charge the battery pack if you have a wireless charger so if you planning to buy this you will have to buy a wireless charger too,neutral

was looking for a more affordable smart phone so i bought this phone because the specs looked really promising ive used moto g in the past and thought with this phones specs it would not hurt to try an asus phone boy was i wrong first off this phone comes jammed packed with asus apps apps that you cannot remove and apps that takes up precious memory space this phone also prompts you to download software upgrades one after another one would think these upgrades would make your phone a bit more advance and usable but these upgrades only makes your phone slower and eventually leads your phone into a bigger issue one that creates a flickering screen a vertical band that causes the user unable to unlock the phone if you are lucky enough where your phone still falls under the manufacturer warranty you can call or chat online with an asus rep and they are issue you a rma with a  charge they will issue you a certified refurbished phoneno guarantee if it has  it is a previously nib defective phone or an old phone that user with similar issues like me sent back it has  it is something you shall  you will have to gamble with since they do not have a walk in center all of this will have to be done via mail or of you can go without a phone you can send it back in for a fix and it saves you the  when you are already frustrated because you have a phone that does not work you shall  you will have to prolong your wait for a phone replacement this is my first experience with an asus phone needless to say it would be my last,neutral

my yezz andy ei is a nice little phone but it has some dealbreaking issues i had previously purchased a newer slightly larger yezz andy ei and loved it so much that i wanted something even smaller for the gym to use over wifi for mpsemailetc the ei is very small and light which is nice however the gb internal storage filled up really fast once i started loading my music on it so i purchased a gb micro sd card which according to the documentation was the max expandable size it could takebut no matter what i do i cannot get the micro sd card to mount in this phone it says it has  it is either bad or damaged or it just does not detect it at all i have tried using other micro sd cards from other working devices and those do not work either if i put a blankformatted micro sd in it will initially say it needs to format it so i do the format but then nothing happens it either will not mount or if it does mount it instantly says the card is baddamaged and it dismounts it i initially thought this problem would work itself out because my yezz ei did the exact same thing at first too but the sd card issue on my ei never resolved itself and it still will not work which really stinks because the primary reason i bought it was to load up my music on it for the gym i also cannot do a software update on this phone it says an update is available but if i try to downloadinstall it the phone just sits on the update screen and nothing happens i have tried rebooting removing battery holding the power key down with battery out all in vain to try and get this phone to work right i would wipe it and start over which i have found by searching online is power key  volume down since the yezz website is a joke for support but since this phone cannot seem to bring down any updates im afraid it would not be able to do a proper system reinstall and then id be stuck with an even worse situation than i have now i do not know if this issue is due to the phone itself or something with the yezz update site but it is really frustratingit has  it is too bad the ei has these system issues because otherwise it is a nice little phone with decent build quality it comes with kitkat  preinstalled and it has  it is not overloaded with bloatware i also got the orange color which is nice and brighti am hoping that the update problem is something with either the yezz update site or the file and they will issue a new software update for this model soon that i will be able to download maybe if a new update is applied it might fix the sd card issue,neutral

i got this as an inexpensive replacement phone for my galaxy s i do not need all the bells and whistles that new phones offer i just need a reliable phone that i can occasionally surf the internet on the go from use spotify to listen to my music and connect to my cars bluetooth for calls and music this does all of that however the most important feature of a phone to me is call quality the call quality is terrible it sounds incredibly tinny and i cannot understand the caller half the time this is only due to to the cheap quality speaker call quality over bluetooth is great,neutral
i was expecting something way cooler it did work but kinda cheesy when you compare it to the samsung newest watch i sent this back,neutral

in general it has  it is a fairly nice watch and works with the bt notification and the mediatek smartdevice app the latter allows for very intricate configuration of app and system service notifications android only four main negative issues while the device is truly m rom and will take firmware updates found in the xda developers forum this hardware does not work properly with those firmware screen appears upside down with other issues this device implies you can set custom wallpaper but when a new image is set it never actually gets applied ive tried x and x sized images in both gif and jpg formats i may have even tried png the bluetooth utility does not have a search feature like my dz this means that if you will have a problem trying to connect bluetooth headphones or headset that rely on the smart device to initiate the pairing so i have not been able to pair my headphones that i used to workout with the pedometer does not seem as accurate as my dz and none of the android apps ive tried on my samsung avant seem to work with calculating the data from the watch into meaningful results calories etc but this has been the case with the dz as well i tried a number of apps on my single avant and tried reboot combinations of all sorts but could not get the apps to receive data even though the phone did connect to the watches successfully,neutral
though the phone barely has any scratches or mishandling marks the iphone i received has a bad case of ghost tapping minus this annoying factor the iphone runs smoothly and the battery last as long as any other iphone,neutral

it has  it is a good phone all around except for the memory it has  it is only got gb of internal memory and the phone will not put anything of value on the sd card i bought  of these phones and was really disappointed because you cannot have what you want on the phone because even the pictures are staying in the internal memory even if you switch it over to the sd card it makes no sense might be ok for a kid bit not for an adult,neutral

i fill that i need to say thisi got the product on time as i expectedand was very pleased about it and wrote good feedback on thatbutim very sorry  i paid for an unlock phone and it is not full un lockedthere is no hebrew languageand cannot used the phone as an hotspot this is because the att service is still living on my phone and the only way to fix it is to root the phone and paying  for it,neutral

mixed bag of pluses and minusespros screenimage quality  i set mine at about  brightness for the most part and it has  it is still very clear and vibrant audio  the dolby hifi is great i just moved from the htc one m with beats audio and the zte is just as good crisp music less bass than the one camera  lots of customization focusing could be faster though dedicated camera shutter button btw does not activate the camera though bloatware  not that many the android os is pretty clean gb ram  no lagging yet highclass style  i have the blue one and the buttons have gold accents nice touchcons processor  playing hungry shark for  minutes caused the back of the phone to be very hot jbl earphones  very cheaply made not worth the  suggested retail price per ztes website my  skullcandy produced better sounds too button placement  i do not like the power button where it is hard to press im always pressing the volume button along with the power button storage capacity  gb but really about gb free to use for personal stuff body  the backing is not completely flush seems to be in three pieces and on mine the top left piece is not perfectly flush to the middle piece kind of shows the lack of  qcfinal thoughtsspecs on paper are amazing truly a flagship competitor however value does not hit a perfect score especially when you can find the brand name flagships at around this price point now lg g for about  on ebay samsung s for about  long term i hope this phone will satisfy my needs and that the warranty will hold up updated  this phone is giving me too many issues not receiving any incoming calls big issue screen rotation gets stuck sometimesi really wanted to like this phone but just too inconsistent so it has  it is heading back to amazon,neutral
i would have given it five stars if they would have included a wall charger,neutral
i really really wanted to love this phone i mean what more could you ask for super thin and light stereo front facing speakers with amazing sound quality full hd screen both bright and crisp nearly pure version of android lollipop respectable battery life jbl headset in the box attractive looks that are just enough different from the crowd for people to ask hey what kind of phone is thatsounds great right the problem for me is twofold  there are only  gb of available storage on the phone which is really really small well you say that should not be a problem because it supports micro sd cards up to gb right  yes it does support micro sd cards but the implementation is almost unusableyou cannot move apps from the phone to the sd card really oh you have the option in application manager to move to sd card but because of the way they have made the filesystem you only have the illusion of the app actually moving move an app and then go look at the sd card in file manager and you find that nothing actually movedfurther some apps like amazon music which allow for selecting where files should go only recognize the sd card some of the time other times nada also sometime the sd card would not mount leaving lots of missed apps and files even though the apps are not  am not actually on the sd cardlast complaint wifi reception and speeds were sketchy compared to all the other devices in my housein the end i sent this phone back and bought a used note  i guess  is just a little too little to charge for a phone,neutral

i bought this phone with the intent to finally own a smartphone i did not want an apple phone and i did not want to spend too much money on higherend phones i was simply looking for a phone that could use all of the android apps had expandable storage had a decent camera and had a minimalistic style ive enjoyed many sony products over the years and i felt that buying this phone would be a good choiceeverything is fine except for one flaw that nagged at me and now killed my love for the phone enough to buy a motorola sonys operating system on this phone is buggy due to the fact that this is not a true android phone but rather an overlayor something like that not all apps work reliably snapchat videos would not always play i experienced lag many times apps would shut off and something that was builtin the camera stopped working reliably making me miss out on many photo opportunities i decided i no longer wanted a phone that made me wonder every time i turned it on if something was going to workaside from things like that the phone is beautiful compact and lightweight i would have kept it if the operating system was more reliable,neutral

good but inside component are exposed such that u are likely to break off any component when inserting the sd if not careful enough this happened to me and i just discovered one tiny component broken because they were not protected or not built away from the sd insert pathwaythese smart watch only read or accepts the  gig sized sd cards as its maximum limitalso it does not play music over bluetooth headset you cannot play your music files through the audio player but through file manger the music audio playback does not play continuously or next audio filethe audio playback stops when u want to use other function,neutral
while i love the phone several things have me wondering what i got  the phone does not look new and probably is not and it does not say anywhere that you are buying a brand new phone  when i opened the back cover there were some scratches on the underside of it and on the frame of the phone below the battery and minor abrasions close to the rear camera which is quite strange to see since i thought it was supposed to be new  the pins for the wireless charging on the back of the frame are indented to one side suggesting it was damaged or not set properly and i have yet to check that out when i eventually get a qi charger for it i at least do not have to buy a wireless sticker since it seems to have one already installed but i know they do not usually come with that and just the nfc sticker module and it does look like it was put on after so yay  the volume buttons are loose and shake everytime i touch them which although not a problem as yet has me wondering about the construction of the phonethat being said pictures are great internet speeds are awesome and pages load very quickly and it does have a lot of features and brilliant colours as well as a bright display lots of customization options and the original charger charges to full in about two hours when the battery was at  aftermarket battery replacements are available in higher ranges for longer use and back cover comes in various colours loads of storage on the the gb and the android  stock runs smooth wireless transfer on bluetooth and wifi is good and nfc functions as expected and most important it works as a phone with full bars where other phones drop to two and three bars i did notice however that the playback for videos can stretch to one side when played in portrait and skews the image when you turn the phone during playback which does get frustrating at times video is very clean and slow motion and ultra hd look very good but p at  frames works best from my experiments overall i would recommend the phone minus the little quirks i had with mine,neutral
i bought this phone to replace a black razr which quit operating i really liked my razr and thought this one would have the same features but it did not maybe it has  it is because it was the international version i do not know but i despise the way it handles multiple entries in the address bookcontact list my previous razr would group all the phone numbers for one person in one entry and a quick navigation to the right would access additional phone numbers for that person when this phone sets up a second phone number for a person it makes a completely new entry so if one person has  different phone or fax numbers their name shows up in the phone list five times also when navigating to a persons name in the contact list i used to be able to start spelling out their name and it would take me right to them on this phone it only allows me to enter the first letter of their name and then i have to use navigation to scroll down through the complete list of people who has  who is name starts with that letter  a complete waste of time especially when trying to shoot off a quick text message this item came with a very small and worthless instruction manual compared to what has shipped with all previous motorola phones i have owned in short i liked the older version of this phone much better  do not be swayed by the cute color,neutral
a poor quality phone but if you need a very slim profile this will do,neutral

the phone showed up a day early which i was excited about it was unlocked and easy to set up it actually did not have any scratches or noticeable damage or scratches anywhere i knew the charger would not be the orginal but the charger i got did not last long the charger started to mess up and i have to play with it to get it to charge until i can get a new charger  the charger is the only reason i do not give  stars,neutral

i bought this phone for my wife because she was wanting a phablet and her neice has the blue studio  and has been very happy with ithowever my wife has used the phone for about a month and there are some things that have been annoying to her for example there are times when a call will come in and she swipes to answer and the call ends other times the phone will ring for a  or  seconds and then the call ends this happens often enough not to be a case of someone changing their mind and hanging up and it happens very rarely on my phone sometimes the phone will start scrolling uncontrollablly i think that these issues may be due to the studio  lte being a new phone and given a year or so to get the final bugs worked out it could be a great phone,neutral
the phone is beautiful and easy to use once activated there were things that did not work i could not send of recieve photos or get an internet connection i was told everything was not unlocked after several attempts by some tech guys that works i like the size and look of the phone there is also a problem knowing when it is or is not charged sometimes hulu and netflex are amazing on it it has  it is been a process and i am satisfied the price was great did i mentioned i love the size,neutral
i really wanted to like this device but after opening it i noticed a bright spot near the bottom of the display after a few days this spot grew into two and got much brighter tapping the screen made that area flash almost as if it were under a lot of pressureperformance of the phone was good but in the end i returned it before the display issue really panned out does not matter how inexpensive a product is it should arrive in  working condition,neutral

the phone is not perfect and it has some drawbacks which ill get to  but let me start with the positive aspectsthe specific handset i received was in excellent condition no signs of use even though it has  it is a refurbished phone the  gigs of memorystorage is nice and more than sufficient to handle the apps  other stuff i want to carry around with me the cpu is fast and the touchscreen is quick and responsive as soon as i turned it on and connected it to my home wifi it automatically downloaded the latest android updates and next thing you know im on marshmallow android  which is a massive change from my previous phone which was on kitkat bluetooth pairing was simple and painless and voice calls are clear and cleanand now for the downsides battery life is horrendous a full battery might not even last a day especially if you are using apps regularly as opposed to simply making phone calls even when doing nothing the battery is constantly draining  it was a bit of a shock to note that the battery level that was  this morning is now at about  when between apps and calls ive only used it for about an hour maybe an hour and a half so far todaythe battery is not removable and there is no sd card slot so i had to jump through some hoops to transfer all my pix and tunes from my old phone  my old phone did not have nfc and it could not automatically back up everything to google so i had to go through the drudgery of creating local backups for contacts and other stuff then uploading everything via usb to my pc then connecting the new phone via usb to the same pc and downloading the stuff i wanted an sd card would have simplified that process very muchif you do not mind keeping the device on a power cord wherever you go then there has  there is probably nothing that is a deal breakerupdate have found a defect  most likely a bug with this specific handset i received so im going to see about a replacement or refund in the next couple days  the nexus  is supposed to have a builtin step counter which can be read by various different fitness apps i believe it is a function of one of the many sensors built in accelerometer gyro proximity compass barometer but i have not found any tech spec that clarifies what component is responsible for this function anyways  it has  it is not working ive installed several different fitnesspedometer apps specifically ones that are reputed to work very well with the nexus  and none of them can see any steps being counted so  this handset i have is defective hence it shall be going back to the seller will update again later with regard to the ease or lack thereof of performing a return or exchangeupdate  returned to amazon for full refund easy process with no problems at all,neutral

my needs were simple a basic candybar phone with number keypad bluetooth and having speed dial so after some playing with this im fairly happyon getting it i was disappointed as the manual said it did speed dial but had no directions and i did not find it in the menus but only after i put a sim in i found speed dial in phonebook settings not easy to find but it worksunlike most basic phones you can dim the display but you also need to turn it back on before beginning to dialand also unlike some other cheap phones it will pull up numbers from the phonebook when you start entering numbersso it works for what i wanted then there has  there is i could not copy files to it by bluetooththe display for reading text and for entering phonebook numbers is very low contrast and does not seem to adjustthe first of those is annoyingmade it difficult to put a custom background or ringtone on it the second would seem to make it almost useless for texting,neutral
not signed up to service yet,neutral
the battery life of the phone is disappointing i am lucky to get a complete day of use i have to assume that this is a refurbished phone and the battery was not changed out nothing in the offer indicated that the phone was used and therefore i am less than happy with the purchase,neutral
i bought two of these phones because i wanted to surprise my friends who were going away on a trip and both of them needed new phones i looked at many different smart phones on here specifically with g lte which in itself narrows the selection this phone stood out to me the price seemed ok the specs sounded fine and the reviews were encouraging so i bought two i was excited about getting them and giving them away but the joy of the surprise did not last very long both phones have inaccurate sensors if i tap a letter in the top row it gives me language selection i need four sometimes five attempts to open an app because it does not respond to lighter touch it becomes extremely annoying when you type a message and it frequently inserts a suggestion just because you typed the letter slightly upward even for a budget phone like this one i expected better adjustment i also could not like in my own phone which was the same price but seems a much better quality calibrate the sensor to have a more accurate typing experience there was no way to fix thisas i gave the two phones away the frustration was high as i felt i had made a bad choice i am returning at least one of them and have already ordered a phone of which i know that it worksthere is some good about these phones however the wifi is relatively fast and the phone itself is fast in opening apps for example the screen is very clear and almost looks like a retina screen very high quality the colors are vibrant this phone comes with a screen protector and a slim silicone case all of that is absolutely great and i like that the sellers do sell a product with thought behind it but all the good does not help if the one thing that makes a phone useable being able to type or press on a symbol is not working well,neutral
i bought the phone just to use on vacation to the states so it was fine for me my first time using a smart phone the biggest problem was the battery died every nightnot even  hours between charges insane i do not have the patience for that,neutral

the description of the product and why i bought it said it was brand new im sorry but it was not it had white caked on dustmud in every crease that the phone has the charger did not fit the phone so had to purchase the correct one hope once the phone charger actually gets here it will be a great working phone giving it  stars because at least the phone screen is not broken,neutral
i purchased this phone with ho as my carrier and the phone did not have full functions  it would not send or receive pictures as part of the text messaging my carrier insisted that this was because it was a blu phone and that they have not been able to have a single one of these phones work i really like this phone it was very sharp looking the display was bright and colorful i really wanted it to work so this is just a heads up to ho users that there has  there is a good chance this phone will not work for youupdate after quite the process they were able to get the picture messages to work but it is still has some glitches just a couple other things to note this phone got pretty hot at the top of the phone where you would be holding it while talking the battery is located lower in the phone so i am not sure why this was happening maybe that explains why the phone is having issues also the charging port is pretty cheap the charger kept falling out if it was barely touched,neutral

ive had this phone for five months and i am rating it three stars because of its questionable durability i have dropped it a couple of times and i think that may be why neither the vibration function nor the frontfacing camera no longer work however i truly appreciate the bluetooth function for my car infotainment system and i appreciate the wifi for my chargepoint ap so that i can remotely cease charging my car i normally do not buy extended warrenties for electronics but i wish that i had for this,neutral

do not get me wrong this is now a bad phone it has  it is just that there are blu phones with more features promised lollipop upgrades and cheaper price points out therethe premise for this phone is appreciated it shares the same snapper that is included in the new blu life one which is an older model camera but still takes great shots the unit has a  screen which is offset by a larger form factor which makes the device seem larger than competitors with like sized screens the screen looks great and shows colors well with no graininess the form factor is certainly comfortable in the hand due to the size however it is oddly rounded at top bottom and back of phone the power button is at top volume buttons on the left and a single camera shutter button on the right if you have owned blu devices before this is odd as generally the buttons all reside on the right side of the phone the charging port is angled and set to the far right of the bottom which makes for awkward placement when charging considering the price of the phone  one would expect there to be some pretty nice standout features ie tap to wake here of which there are nonenote the camera app has many great features as it should with a phone called selfiethere are other blu devices out currently that employ a fantastic  core mediatek processor and great camera blu life xl blu vivo air at a cheaper price this is just a very bland phone for the price you payi certainly would recommend this phone at a price similar to blus other flagshiplike devices,neutral
the phone arrived ok and in the expected time but the charger that came with it is not working i am kind of disappointed,neutral

i love this phonei did love this phone im having problems with the screen locking up on me then i have to sometimes turn the phone completely off the sensitivity is ridiculous when i try to scroll a page if there has  there is a link picture or anything that can be clicked on the phone picks up on my fingertip and clicks it super annoying the camera kind of sucks hard to get a clear photo i do not like the opera software maybe just the layout but i do not like it the battery even if im not using the phone the battery drains very quick yes i shut off all running apps turn off background data for apps that has  that is allow i always let it completely die before i charge it so im not killing the battery life or wasting it i dont keep it plugged in for extended amounts of time i definitly will be going back to samsung sorry blu,neutral
phone came fast everything worked but the ring tone was not as loud as another phone exactly like the one purchased really sad because it was a gift to my parents that have hearing problems i wanted to return the phone but my parents did not want me to go thought all the trouble they wanted to live with the defective phone and it is sad because we did not find this out until we set up the phone to work what their numberi should have bought them a new phone instead of a refurbished one but they did not want me to spend the extra price for a new phonethe three stars is only basted on not being satisfied with the quality and not based on the return policy or the company,neutral

did not work in my area so be sure to check before purchasing it said it would work but did not could not even activate,neutral
everything is well but the only thing i noticed is that the package itself is not sealed usually every brand new product is sealed but this one does not have i did not mind returning them cause it would be a hassle on my part,neutral
so the phone itself is good and the camera is excellent however some of the posts about carrier support can be misleading the support of tmobile is missing a couple of bands which leads to spotty coverage on edge and g coverage areas,neutral
let me start this review my saying that i came from an old iphone gs while i enjoy the hardware and software quality of my apple product i did not at all enjoy the longterm expensive contract that came with it im usually around areas with wifi so paying each month for a required data package did not make much sense to me i wanted a phone and carrier plan that met my needs not the other way aroundwhen my twoyear contract expired i began researching various phones and carrier plans i wanted a smartphone apple spoiled me there but it did not have to have all the bells and whistles i mostly wanted something that could play music while on road trips and allow me to reliably call and text my buddies the exhibit ii was the phone that seemed to meet all my needsafter owning the phone for a month i can say that it does a fairly decent job at meeting my needs however there are a number of flaws in the phone that make using it quirky and often irritating below are my general procon thoughts on the phoneprosthe screen is noticeably brighter and of higher quality than my old iphone everything looks crisp and detailedthe exhibit ii is a good bit lighter and less bulky than my iphone it feels much more at home in my pocketi save  a month in comparison to my old att bill the phone will pay for itself in just five monthsflawsthe touchscreen is flat out not as responsive as my iphone gs i often have to touch or drag multiple times in order to get input to be registered i get the impression that it is less a flaw of the touchscreen than the processor in the phone trying to keep up with my actions for it feels somewhat laggy with a ghz snapdragon however i did not expect such sluggishnessthere is something wrong with the volume control when i attempt to make calls if i toggle the volume up nothing will happen i discovered with some experimentation that i first have to press the volume control down before i can press it up to make it louder this is very counterintuitive and frankly annoyingthere is a loud pop though the earpiece a few seconds after i press send to make a call i have to hold the phone away from my ear to save my eardrums some painthis phone has a good bit of bloatware installed i thought apple exercised tight control over their users but i cannot even delete the useless junk on my exhibit iid games do not run all that well even simpler games such as temple run exhibit enough lag to stymie your gameplay experiencethere is a significant delay between when i press the button to take a photograph and when that photograph is actually taken the delay can be anywhere between one and four seconds this is a major issue if you are tying to take a photograph in a pinch more often than not you will miss that special momentthis is not really a flaw in the phone itself but i do not get very good service where i live the tmobile map showed that i was in a lighter green but i get more dropped calls and interference than what i did with attthe samsung exhibit ii runs an older version of the andriod os gingerbread and it does not look like tmobile has plans to update the phone to ice cream sandwichthe tmoible myaccount software will not work unless use packet data is enabled under settings  wireless and network  mobile networks i generally keep packet data off so that i do not accidentally use data while out and about it is annoying that i first must enable this to see how i am doing in terms of my minutes and text messagestext messages occasionally fail to send i sometimes have to attempt the send multiple times before it will go throughother thoughtsthis is just personal opinion but andriod feels much less polished than ios with my iphone i never worried about restarting my device to keep it running well my exhibit ii on the other hand reminds me every week or two that it is time to reboot the phone so that it can continue operating properlymalware seems to be fairly rampant on the andriod platform i cringe at the thought of malware getting on a heavy communication device such as my phonesetting up my phone was not as smooth as i would like it to have been i attempted to perform the setup through the tmobile web portal but i continually got a message partway through stating that my account was processing and that i should wait after a couple days of waiting i called tmobile and painlessly set up my account through one of their agentsconclusionthis is a decent phone if all you are looking to do is make a few calls play music and perhaps do minimal web browsing if you are a heavy cell phone user and are looking for a phone that will play the latest games text run the latest software and do heavy multimedia then i recommend looking elsewhere,neutral

i previously had this phone and it was great since i liked it so much i got it again im having a lot of problems with it now what i can say is buy it new instead of from a previous owner simply because you do not know how long they have had the phone and if the warranty is expired you have to pay to get the phone fixed instead of the repair being free also you do not know what damage has been done but because i ie owned this phone i know it has  it is a great phone if it has  it is a new phone it should not have any problems,neutral
in general it has  it is a fairly nice watch and works with the bt notification and the mediatek smartdevice app the latter allows for very intricate configuration of app and system service notifications android only four main negative issues while the device is truly m rom and will take firmware updates found in the xda developers forum this hardware does not work properly with those firmware screen appears upside down with other issues this device implies you can set custom wallpaper but when a new image is set it never actually gets applied ive tried x and x sized images in both gif and jpg formats i may have even tried png the bluetooth utility does not have a search feature like my dz this means that if you will have a problem trying to connect bluetooth headphones or headset that rely on the smart device to initiate the pairing so i have not been able to pair my headphones that i used to workout with the pedometer does not seem as accurate as my dz and none of the android apps ive tried on my samsung avant seem to work with calculating the data from the watch into meaningful results calories etc but this has been the case with the dz as well i tried a number of apps on my single avant and tried reboot combinations of all sorts but could not get the apps to receive data even though the phone did connect to the watches successfully,neutral
i really like the styly of this phone the color is something that really works well for me the size fits great in my back pocket when im on the gofuctions well and no problems so far after owning it for two monthsthe issues i have with this is the amount of apps that come on it way to many and burns up my space on the phone they can not be deleted at least i havent found a way to delete them if you want to have a large amount of pics and videos on it you need to get a sd card overall i really like the phone,neutral

the phone works well but the glass on the front breaks very easily after using an older smartphone for the past  years with no issues it was quite surprising and disappointing to pull this one out of my pocket just a few days after i started using it and find that the front of the screen had a crack all the way through it the phone still works but the large crack across the screen makes me sad every time i see it,neutral
as a construction contractor most ordinary cells can not stand up to the amount of abuse that comes with that profession so something more rugged was required typically our phones get dropped off of roofs left in the rain or smashed against tools in a pocket also using a smartphone at work is almost out of the question as it would certainly be shattered and is naturally too expensive to replace enter an inexpensive unlocked quadband ip grade phone like the ram is this the best rugged phone out there most unlikely but it will do what a phone was originally designed to do at a price that wont make one cringe at the end of the day pop out the sim and one can continue with the touchscreen experience to which the world has become painfully obsessed an adapter will be required as both of the rams sim slots are standard sizeprosrelatively inexpensiveextremely long battery life traditional dumb phones typically have an approximately  mah battery the ram has a  mah i believeit feels decently rugged and is ip rated but we have yet to put it through any torture testsit has  it is not obsessively heavy or largequad band and unlockedsd slotdual sim though we have not tried using that featurededicated flashlight buttonfast startup and shutdownconsdoes not work with all networks due to being gsm only that means no bell networks in canada and i believe no verizon networks in th usthe camera is low resolution by todays standards also it has no flash as the phones led is mounted on top of the handset and only functions as a flashlightthe interface is typical of cheep chinese phones and needs polishing doing any more than simply dialing numbers is cumbersome though with this handset there is little function other than dialing anywaythe bumpers on the exterior are quite hard they are not rubber they are still easy enough to grip and will help protect the phone but they feel cheapthere is practically no onboard memory however given the limited function of the handset it makes little differenceall the keys are rather small and topped with hard glossy plastic i do not think using this while wearing gloves will be possible for most peopleconclusion good as a second handset in an environment where one would not want to carry a more expensive or delicate device however if this is to be used as the sole device there are other handsets with better features and ergonomics albeit being more expensive if an ip grade phone is not required there are plenty of nonrugged unlocked phones on amazon with lower price tags as well,neutral
it has  it is a good solid phone with a lot of features in there i would say  pricecontent ratio is very good but it has  it is already a second brand new nokia phone i am returning before it was nokia n for the same reason the quality of sound during a conversation is very very poor  a some sort of static noise the voice itself is not clear at all  i had to ask to repeat last sentence several times during a conversation very frustrating second thing  volume control buttons and speech activation button located on the right side are very hard to click  especially taking into account that this phone is very slim  actually i had to hold it with  hands to increase the volume or activate a voice calling feature i was a huge fan of nokia until two recent purchases of new nokia phones  i am afraid this company went on a wrong path by chasing the longer list of additional cool features in a phone and lost the phone itself,neutral

there are so many things i like about this phone the octacore processor is responsive and apps load quickly the clever camera setup takes awesome pictures in full sunlight and pretty good pictures in low light the screen resolution is the best ive seen on any zte phone and on many phones overall and the phone charges faster than any phone ive ever had these features and gb of storage for this price is such a better value than what you get from apple and samsungthat said all that power does burn through the battery very quickly if you know you are not going to be able to recharge and that you are going to need the phone all day then the available battery save mode is absolutely required just sitting the phone on my desk without any activity for a couple of hours can burn  or more off the battery even though ive not directly used ithowever because of the super fast charging capability the battery usage is not a deal killer the thing that might be is the phones issues with my mobile provider on the one hand sitting in my driveway the afternoon i got the service the phone did a speed test that topped out at mbps down i was absolutely floored id never seen such performance i thought id finally come up with the best combination of phone hardware and lowcost mobile service providerthen i went on vacation we went to the crystal coast of north carolina and my shiny new phone was in brick mode all week it seems obvious that the network would be the issue being out on a barrier island and all but two other folks in my party with the same service one with an iphone the other with a lowend samsung smartphone had at least  or  bars all week long my phone was only good over wifi i only got text messages after driving many miles off the island and either powering the phone off and back on or more annoyingly popping the sim card out and back inive still got a ticket open with the mobile provider because i know the phone worked on the island  i was able to call  for customer service using the phone and i was able to call  after a lightning bolt set a nearby telephone pole on fire so i know the radio worked maybe the service provider was preventing me from connecting for some reason but it really begs the question of why folks with different hardware were able to use the service and i was noton the long ride home from the beach the mobile coverage is spotty in rural north carolina virginia and west virginia and though all of us lost mobile coverage at various points the iphone always seemed to recover without intervention when a signal became available while i was repeatedly required to pop the sim card out and back in to reset it if id been on a long trip driving alone i would have just been unavailable and out of luck until i pulled over for me this is the deal killer the phone has got to be resilient to varying network conditions as i travel first and foremost it has to at least be a mobile phone i love that it has  it is highperforming and much more affordable but if i cannot trust it to work when i need it to i have to question what kind of value im gettingim going to wait to find out what the service provider has to say about why i was prevented from connecting to the network out on the island but the seed of doubt i now have about whether or not i can trust the phone when im traveling may be the reason i end up sending it back it has  it is an elegant highperforming device in many ways but if i cannot call or send a text message someplace where i know there is coverage then this attractive flagship phone is not a value at any priceive got another short trip planned this time to northern michigan if the phone works there like it has  it is supposed to then maybe ill give it a second chance but if it fails there as well and is not resilient to the sketchy network conditions in that part of the world then ill have no choice but to send it back and try something else,neutral
really heavy phone compared to my samsung tablet it was big it did not bother me but people always asking if i had a tablet or a phone so got tired of it front camera was crappy back camera was good it would not catch up when i was texting or the home button was on the screen so it was kind of annoying while texting it would bring me right back to the home page love the color and the screen was hard battery lasted a very long time worth the price kind of yes and no but i returned it before it got the  month gerent so now i ordered the blu vivo  i cant wait to receive it its amazing and that is worth its price,neutral

i purchased this phone as a replacement for my other samsung which was a similar phone it is sleek and i am pleased with it for the most part i purchased this phone to use on the straight talk network because other reviewers here said it would work fine that is true however it does not work on the verizon network as my first phone did this phone works on the att network and getting it activated took several calls to straight talkalso it seems i can not reply all to group text messages which is aggravating it is a no frills phone and lacks many of the setting choices mostly for texting that other samsung phones have all and all i am not a big techie so this phone is fine for my needs but if you need all the bells and whistles this phone may not be for you,neutral
i wanted a good rugged phone to use while working outdoors and in the garage this phone fit the bill to a large extentthe good i do not have excellent hearing and the sound was very good the speakerphone sound and volume is unbeatable very clear both receiving and sending i could roll over on it without damaging it while working under a car with it in my pocketthe bad the main toggle button was a bit finicky it would not always scroll down without multiple pushes when i shut it too hard the battery connection would fail and id have to take the battery out and reinstall it before i could turn it on againoverall this phone served me well for about a year then i finally gave in to peer pressure and got a smart phone,neutral

i purchased this unlocked phone because i had been disappointed with a replacement sent to me by att the phone seemed to have the features i was after and it did i liked it for the most part after only a few weeks the coating on the  external buttons began peeling off this is no big deal as it does not at all effect the usability of the phone just looks bad after four months of use the screen and buttons both began not working the phone is under warranty and has been sent back for a repairreplacement the company seemed to be easy to work with so far but we will see it seemed like four months was not long to last so i fear that the replacement will probably only last till around the end of the warranty period for the money spent i expected a phone that would last a couple years if taken care of and it was taken care of it had never been droppedor gotten wet and had a good screen protector installed on the day it arrived to me i will update this review as i get the replacement and see how it holds upupdatewell the service was fine got the phone back in a reasonable amount of time and it had been repaired it seemed fine and worked for another few months again it stopped working still under warranty so i sent it off again the company again has been good in that it has sent me a new phone i just feel like there is no way the phone will last past the end of the warranty i still like the phone but the quality is obviously not there,neutral

it has  it is not as great as my old lumia two major problems im experiencing with this phone low battery life wifidata constantly dropsbatterythe blu studio  c hd has a  mah battery which i thought was a step up from my lumia s  mah battery big mistake when i begin my day with  charge i can just leave it on and do nothing and watch the percent drop in a matter of minutes if i leave if in my pocket with the screen locked and turn off wifi and data and all location services and have the phone running in power saver mode with the brightness all the way down i find that it loses  charge in about  minutes this is atrocious im scared to watch what happens when i actually use the phone when i do use it to the max with a few apps running and wifi on i watch it lose about  per  minutes yes the display is p but that should not be a problem the windows os must use little power or something because my lumia could last me at least one and half days only now after two years it has begun to lose charge faster but still can get a full day of use the lumia has a smaller display coming at  and a really low res of x but it has a smaller batter too yet it still lasts longer than the bluwifidataboth this phone and my old lumia  from about two years ago have up to wireless n and g hspa however the blu studio  c hd constantly drops from the network it says that it has  it is still connected to wifi and data but it does not update anything i do not get new hangoutfacebook messages and i cannot use the browser it only begins to work once i turn off wifi and then turn it back on and same with data im guessing this is an os problem and ill see if i can try it with a custom romif the charging port on my lumia was not broken i would not have switched to this phone im thinking of just getting the wireless charging shell for the lumia and a qi plate and then just using the blu only for the few android apps it offers that i need that i cannot get on windows phone,neutral

i do not love this phonei had a nexus  for a couple of years  until the power button went wonky so i researched phones and bought the zenfonei hate bloatware this phone has tons of annoying asus applications after having the pure android experience with the nexus  i find all of the zenfone apps just annoying who caresthe camera is pretty bad it does fine in bright sunlight do not try to take a photo indoors without a flash i likeed to take photos of the live music shows i go to i could take pretty good photos with the nexus  in a club  with stage lighting not so with the zenfone i have pretty much given up taking those kind of photosand  i shot myself in the foot  with a clever app on the zenfone there is a settings app that lets you control whether or not an app should be started automatically when the phone boots up sounds like a good thing to do  reduce memory usage etc i did this with the messaging app i expected that i would still receive texts or that they would be queued nope if you do not let the messaging app autostart  the phone will just not receivedrop any texts while the texting app is not onit is hard to debug a problem where you are just not receiving texts i did not know i had a problem until my daughter said she had sent me several texts  that i never received so  that was kind of disappointing any setting where you could just lose texts  should probably warn you that this could happenmy son who has a  htc phone says  you get what you pay for his phone has a pretty good camera but still has the bloatware i looked at getting a nexus   but it seemed too big to fit in my pocket so i am kinda stuck with this phone for a couple of years,neutral

i have owned an iphone for the last  years and like many of the customers of this phone switched in an attempt to reduce my cellular expensesmy expectations were really high and so was the disappointment im still giving this phone  stars because its probably a good smartphone if not compared to the iphone i can get used to the android interface and structure  that has  that is not the issue my quarrel with this phone is perhaps not even with the hardware rather with it has  it is android os deployment the issue is that of stability in less than one week of ownership i have had to reboot it numerous times had multiple occasions of an applications responding very slowly and have seen some odd behavior such as text messages forwarded to multiple email boxes without solicitationim hoping that all these issues will get resolved via firmwareos updates as much as i wanted this phone to be an equal replacement to my iphone unfortunately it is not,neutral
i purchased this phone for my birthday last year and at first sight i was in love after using it for  months i realized that it was freezing up often and also it tends to automatically lock or restart in the middle of texting it is very specific when it comes on to the type of headphones you use i normally take care of headphones and mine broke in  months i was really upset because any other headphones it would not be loud if you are used to fast g data i would not recommend this phone because it is ok with with speed it is not fast especially if you are a frequent user of snapchat and instagram because videos take long to load or will not load at all also the charging port is very slack any little tug on the cord and the cord will fall out as for the battery life it is really good if your not a heavy texter like i am and i also always keep my brightness down i would recommend a sd card if you take a lot of pictures because it does not have a lot of space still waiting on the upgrade to lollipop  thoughotherwise it is durable phone for the priceupdate ive had this phone for about a year now and i am completley disappointed to update my previous review on the phone it freezes up more now the lollipop update is still on this phone the battery life is awful now you charge overnight for the next day and by the time you leave the house i can tell you you will lose about  after it coming off the charger space is very limited even if you have a sd card the preinstalled apps will not be able to update because of the limited gb of space the case that came in the box helped a bit when it fell on concrete twice but it also becomes very slack also the phone tends to overheat a lot sometimes i have to turn it off i am sorry but my experience with blu is not good my mom and dad both had the vivo air my dads screen cracked within the first couple months and the phone itself was restarting over and over it would not reboot my mothers phone as well the screen cracked and my mother only uses the phone for basic textcall and email we are not statisfied with them at all we understand that they are budget phones but at the same time we expect good money for them so honestly in my opinion and with my experience i would not recommend them for teenagers or anyone for that matter,neutral
this phone sounded like a dream come true gb of ram gb of internal memory with expandable memory long battery life fingerprint reader and best of all affordablei was very excited to have this phone i even preordered it so essentially ive had the phone since it has releasednow remember those features we have all been wanting in an affordable smart phone let us talk about them  months into owning this phoneprocessing speedthis phone is not the speediest although i knew this when i purchased the phone i was expecting to have lag and stutter on the phone every now and then especially for demanding applications i found this phone struggling way too often with apps like snapchat and chrome i came from a nexus  and the performance that i was getting was about the same in some cases worst although when it comes to things like messages phone calls and less demanding apps like twitter it ran without hiccups again it has  it is important to take the phone price into consideration but im pointing out performance because that gb of ram is not helping too muchfingerprint readerthe fingerprint reader works okay when i made a profile for my thumb to be able to unlock the phone the process was painless although when it came to unlocking my phone it frequently did not registered my thumb i would try different positions but no luck what i did to remedy this was make different profiles of the same thumb this way it allowed for more ways for my thumb to be positioned it worked but then another problem came up the fingerprint reader is positioned in a spot where it gets a lot of finger time so it tends to get a bit smudgy and i often have to wipe the fingerprint reader for it to read my finger ive asked others about their fingerprint scanners on their phones such as iphones and lg phones and that issue is not as common although those are  devicescamerathe camera is okay i could not imagine what the non plus model camera is like it takes awesome pictures if the lighting is great and the objects are not  am not moving it does take pictures very slowly especially with hdr on one thing that is inconvenient about the phone is that it zooms in a little when recording video another is that when it comes to snapchat video it performs awfully the video playback runs extremely choppybattery lifethe battery life is really really great with lighttomoderate use it gets a full ampm charge the battery takes about  hours to charge from  to deal breaking issuethe phone recently started to have some major issues it shuts off randomly when the battery is below about  let us say im at a concert and i want to take a picture if the phone is at  as soon as i open either snapchat or the camera app it just shuts off when the percentage is lower the problem gets worse at about  ive had the phone shut off when i open my regular apps such as twitter or google maps this has been a huge headache and has ruined the phone experience for meive submitted for a replacement and hopefully these issues do not exist anymore but until then my review will stay like this,neutral

i bought this phone on amazon in september of  i had no complaints for the first year it was fast compact charged really quickly and held the charge all day after about a year i had to start manipulating the charger for it to work ive used other chargers and have had the same issue with all but one blackberry charger that we keep at worknot long after this issue began the battery life took a dive i now have to charge it twice per day unless i literally do not use the phone at all even then the battery is dead by  pm i kill apps regularly and use power saving mode as welljust this past week i tired of constantly having to charge my phone and decided to buy a replacement battery good thing i have not gotten around to it yet because the external speaker broke two days ago no notifications alarms music or speaker phone the sound comes through headphones and i can hear voice calls as long as i do not use speaker which is a pain for me because my phone is always on the charger in a strange position and if i pick it up to talk it will not charge i also need the alarm to wake up for work but i do have an old alarm clock hanging around somewhere to get me by until i can purchase a new phoneother than these more annoying than anything problems this is a great starter phone or device for someone who likes being able to browse online but does not necessarily do anything that would require more speed or memory the g is fast the main camera takes  minutes to take a picture but the front camera is quick the flash is blinding and works great as a flashlight and the flashlight app makes a cool noise that i can no longer hear it did not come with an alarm app but i downloaded one that works fine it had started slowing down and freezing months ago so ive taken to turning it off daily which is probably a good habit to have oh and it overheats if you are on the phone too long but that is also a recent problem and could be related to the batteryall in all a fine device as long as you do not plan on using it all day or for many years i plan on upgrading to an s iii and i love samsung products you will not find accessories in stores as readily as you find s series or iphone products but amazon and ebay have good selections in cases for really cheap i recommend keeping a screen cover on it,neutral

overall i like the phone it feels sturdy and has a great battery life one drawback is that this phone has nowhere near  gb of internal storage try only  gb of internal memory i like this phone and the many features that are unique to this phone and many other newer lg phones but i just quite like the low internal memory capacity and with many phones having an internal memory capacity of no lower than  gb lg should have known better than toprovide such a low memory capacity but with that said this is still a good phone the low memory capacity is the reason im rating this  stars,neutral

this is an addendum to my sellers feedback though poorly packaged the item is new i think except for the battery and a tiny piece of rubber that has  that is supposed to be covering a screw for vanity reason the battery was in the box with the rest of the stuff unprotectedunwrapped with minor stainsdents the original packaging from sony ericsson is very generic there is no model numberserial with photos on box as you would expect if purchased from a sony store the owners manual is a generic one not printed for any particular models inside the phoneaccessories ie battery charger lid were tossed together like a salad nothing was securely in their proper slot i am not sure if that has  that is how it came in from the manufacturer sony ericsson to the wholesaler but this purchase could easily be mistaken for being used or refurbished fact i check my purchase details several times upon receiving the package just to make sure i purchased a new item vs used or refurbished nothing personal but id think twice about this company before purchasing from them again as for now i am content with the item because it works im keeping my fingers crossed hoping that it will hold up like a sony ericsson and not breakdown on me because it was mishandled by a third party or it was usedrefurbished and listed as new for what it has  it is worth thank you unlockedcellphonekings you have made quite an impression on me,neutral

this was supposed to be a new phone there was something wrong with the charging cable as the phone did not recognize it as an apple product the contacts looked dirty and half the time it would not charge at all the phone also drops the wifi connection frequently im not all that happy with it but to be fair im still getting to know it expected better,neutral

very disappointing the phone itself is great love the features this is my second windows phone so i had a pretty good idea on the ins and out of a wp however the dissapointed part comes in the way of a disingenuous description from the seller st of all the phone was used i kinda had a feeling about this when it arrived in a shoddy old looking box my assumption was confirmed when i took a look within the call timer and it displayed over  minutes of call duration even that would have been okay if the phone was indeed unlocked as the seller claims however the phone i received was not i paid for an unlocked phone but got a locked phone as far as the phone i give it  stars delivery gets a  and the seller because of the false claims get a ,neutral

there seems to be a lot of functions on the watch but the manual is vague at bestif your going to put in only name and  for the phone i recommend you put it to the sim card twice now we lost data that was saved to the watch not sure why it is supposed to have voice command capability but could not get it to recognize any commandif you turn on voice for phone numbers to be audible it only speaks in chinese no matter what language is selectedthe plus side calls a crisp and clear on the receiving end and the speaker option to the watch is hard to hear the mp  player is good with the included ear budsonly way mps can be played the stylus is neatly tucked in the band and does not slip outthe watch will accept a gb micro sd card it keeps time well and can choose time as a screen saver and then just tap the screen for it to display i actually bought this for my wife so she could have an easily accessible phone that was easy to use and out of the way and can be used quickly in an emergency the battery life is good and it comes with a spare battery it is a good price when you consider you get blue tooth ear phone and charging cable ear buds two batteries charging unit for phone and blue tooth can only charge one at a time,neutral

good but inside component are exposed such that u are likely to break off any component when inserting the sd if not careful enough this happened to me and i just discovered one tiny component broken because they were not protected or not built away from the sd insert pathwaythese smart watch only read or accepts the  gig sized sd cards as its maximum limitalso it does not play music over bluetooth headset you cannot play your music files through the audio player but through file manger the music audio playback does not play continuously or next audio filethe audio playback stops when u want to use other function,neutral

in general it has  it is a fairly nice watch and works with the bt notification and the mediatek smartdevice app the latter allows for very intricate configuration of app and system service notifications android only four main negative issues while the device is truly m rom and will take firmware updates found in the xda developers forum this hardware does not work properly with those firmware screen appears upside down with other issues this device implies you can set custom wallpaper but when a new image is set it never actually gets applied ive tried x and x sized images in both gif and jpg formats i may have even tried png the bluetooth utility does not have a search feature like my dz this means that if you will have a problem trying to connect bluetooth headphones or headset that rely on the smart device to initiate the pairing so i have not been able to pair my headphones that i used to workout with the pedometer does not seem as accurate as my dz and none of the android apps ive tried on my samsung avant seem to work with calculating the data from the watch into meaningful results calories etc but this has been the case with the dz as well i tried a number of apps on my single avant and tried reboot combinations of all sorts but could not get the apps to receive data even though the phone did connect to the watches successfully,neutral

i bought this phone in a pinch when my cell phone broke and i was not due for an upgrade for a whole year the phone lasted me almost that whole year but unless you are facing a similar circumstance i would not recommend buying this phone it breaks quite easily the battery life is abysmal and as its condition deteriorates it will sometimes refuse to turn on or charge on multiple occasions it actually erased all of the information on the microsd card which i put in it on the upside the screen is virtually shatterproof,neutral
part of right side screen does not work other than that good phone,neutral
first i got a cheap china knock off i had read the reviews before buying and was aware that quite a few people have had this same problem and was looking out for it it did not say otterbox on it anywhere and the underside was plane i called amazon customer service and explained the problem pointed out other reviews that i read pointed out the picture and description said i would be getting a real otterbox they were very helpful and told me to do whatever with the fake and they would refund the money and i could reorder it to try again i reordered it when i was still on the phone with customer service and the guy told me he was making a note on it to see that it was an otterbox and not a fake and that has  that is the best he could do when the second one came it was in a nicer bag that was thicker and resealed and looked just like the picture with otterbox on it and had markings on the underside with a patent number and other numbers ive been using it for a week and am happy with it so far the clip that said otterbox on it seems thicker nicer plastic the biggest difference being in the belt clip it releases better turns easier and looks nicer,neutral

the description of this product is false and misleading the a model does not have a  ghz processor as a glance at the back of the package will confirm   ghz is written in large bold letters plain as day the only reason i paid the exorbitant price greed i mean breed was charging initially is that i thought this was an upgraded model nope it has  it is the same thing other companies that know their stock were offering for  cheapersecond let me say that the only reason to buy this phone is if you want an unlocked phone with no more than a  display and android  and even then you might find better options if you are not fooled about what you are getting this is a fair phone it has  it is going to be dog slow for a lot of applications but it has got a recent version of android and its processor beats the first generation nexus phonesthe builtin speaker is about the same as the nexus ones and the phone speaker and microphone have not given me any problems conversing with people the construction is lighter and cheaper than im used to but adequate the screen is bright and clear and reasonably responsivebattery life is only tolerable if you use it lightly ive been recharging twice a day using wifi only and very few actual phone callsthere are quite a few odd apps in the all apps list one of them is named comandriodsecuritycore yes it has  it is spelled andriod ive done two hard resets since getting this device and the app is definitely part of the firmware so i suspect it has  it is ok but im trying to get blus service department to confirm thatthe camera has extremely low resolution for a modern phone if you are only taking photos to post to facebook no problem but do not expect to print anything it will take tolerable p video however the flash is useless any farther than a meter away and both photos and video will be very grainy with indoor lighti was surprised to find that this phone will play p h video in mkv format reasonably well of course it has  it is being shrunk down to fit the small screen and it has  it is probably only getting  frames per second with all the frame drops but id watch it in a pinch p does much better and unlike the older phones this one does not choke on bframesthe dual sim slots include a standard and a micro the phone comes with a flexible plastic cover that might offer some protection but definitely interferes with pressing the volume and power buttons i think a bit of work with an exacto knife might help that but i have not tried yetif you must have a small android phone the life play mini will probably do but if you can stand one even a bit larger there are much better options,neutral
i needed a new phone becuase i broke my other one so i selected a new iphone i got this phone in the mail and everything on it works fine and runs like it should as for the charger i got it was a used charger and didnt work at charging my iphone i contacted customer service and they told me to contact apple i contacted apple then went back to the seller to try and get my ac charger replaced or have them send me a new one niether has happened very disappointed in the customer who is selling this product bottom line is phone is great seller is terrible,neutral

bought for my son for christmas with the intention of using att i took it to the att store and they checked it all out and said it would work only for phone calls and texting but not for data because the firmware in the phone that has the settings for data that works with att was outdated and would not work on their system i looked at the blu website and they tell you how to update to the latest android version on some of their phones but i see no way to upgrade the firmware that corresponds to all the phone carrier settings that would make it active on a sim card the phone itself is nice and my son really likes it so far and i did get him a pay as you go phone and text plan from att but no data yes i suppose i could send it back to try to get an updated phone but he has been using it for at about a week right after christmas before i took it to att and does not want to have to wait to get a replacement he uses our wifi at home or school to get online really the bottom line is i should not have to send something back for being outdated that i just bought as new who wants to mess around with all that hassle had i known ahead of time i would not have gotten this phone but i my son will live with it for nowso i can only give this  stars for them selling a phone that is outdated i took it to the att store within  weeks of my purchase date since it was wrapped under the tree then he used it before i activated the phone and it should not have had outdated firmware is anyone aware of how to get the firmware on line i would have no problem updating it myself since i have done so on other nonphone devices but i see no way to do that from the blu website,neutral

very good phone in aspect to the price i bought the phone for the sim from original country im currently in us  carrier but the thing that i did not figure out until i received is it does not support any languages other than the ones coming with system even in sms messages which is pretty logical if you would ask so yeah that has  that is as my only issue with this phone and as i told im using it just to receive any important messagescalls from my nonus number,neutral

it seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves who break the phones box seal open the box and unlock the phones themselves note that samsung says do not accept if seal is broken hence technically most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new i bought a lot of samsung galaxy s edge phones from amazon and most not all had the seal brokenon the phone itself this is the best phone i have ever tried slick light balanced fantastic screen fast water proof and so on  its only caveat and an important one is the lack of removable battery samsung lost the removable batter starting with the s i like this phone much better than the edge the s edge has a bigger screen but the resolution is the same as with the s and its edges are highly annoying making one touch them by mistake constantly furthermore the edges edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case  not a problem with the regular sfinally the only difference between the gf single sim version and the gfd dual sim version is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card which is recognized by the devices os,neutral

the phone itself works great but there are some issues the phone does not display the battery charge level or signal strength the user can find basic info such as fair signal but they have to go through the phones menus and search activation is a pain the butt the website is very picky and asks for things like an  character passphrase it can take anywhere from  hours to get the phone activated if you want to keep your old number you have to wait for the phone to be fully activated before you can begin the number porting process which will take another  days when it has  it is all said and done it can take up to a week to get the phone activated with your old number and you are paying for service this entire time for comparison purposes it took me  minutes to activate and port a number from verizon sprint and it took an hour to do the same thing with att the last drawback is the great calls solicitation calls we have the account setup exactly the way they want but they regularly call my dad and try to talk him into added additional services there should be a way to block these calls,neutral
this phone was a great disappointment i gave it  stars for the simple fact it has not dropped any calls yet and the screen is easy to read the back button has stopped working and none of the buttons at the bottom have ever lit up so you cannot see where they are at it dropps internet constantly to top it all off the charging cord is very loose and also constantly falls out,neutral

phone itself is pretty fast but you get short battery life leftover images from previous apps and sometimes it gets to be a bit slow when you have multiple apps running in the background otherwise it has a pretty loud speaker fairly bright screen and decent size memory definitely better than a windows phone so  out of  stars seems right hopefully lollipop comes out soon for this phone,neutral

my son wanted a watch so i researched all over amazons choices this watch seemed to be excellent it came in i did not even open it just gave it to my son excited he has  he is  and a tech junkie he took one look at it and tossed it aside he has  he is about  feet tall and a big guy so it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him he said the watch face itself is much too huge too thick too big for him to wear he did not like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it altogether and was not interested in it any further he left on the table beside him and did not give it a second look even though i advised him all it could do nope not even remotely interested because it was too big i tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him ive still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago im keeping it though hoping that one day it will be useful to me im thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes but i really cannot speak up on it i have not used it no one wants to wear such a thick faced watch so the technical features have not yet been experienced so if i do take the time to find someone to use it i will be sure to update you on that the three stars is only that no one wants to wear it,neutral

st of all when it says the phone is unlocked it is true however you need to configure some stuff so that it will allow you to use your simstep  turn off all connections which is basically the mobile networkstep  go to manage connectionsstep  go to mobile network and search for network technologystep  chance your network technology to gsmumtsstep  optional change network mode to any mode depending on your providerstep  shutdown the phone and turn back onstep  go to manage connections and turn mobile network back onhopefully this helps you all with a problem that i had which was really frustratingphone may be unlocked but you need to configure it to allow the sim card to work,neutral

i was looking to upgrade my phone and a cousin referred this to me as she had just gotten it i played around with hers and then i ordered it in november it worked fine up until three weeks ago he only issue i had with it was that the wifi antennae is very weak sometimes at home i would have to stand right next to the router to get wireles and then when im at work or out it shows a message that wifi is available but it doesnt connect easilyhowever the problems with the phone have gotten worse i miss out on many impportant calls because the phone constantly says no service there is just a red x where the service bars should be as the phoneis dualsim i thought the problem may have been with my service provider so i bought another sim from another service provider now there are two red xssometimes i would try to make a call or answer a call and the service would drop this is very inconvenient and just not worth the  now i need to purchase another phone in less than  monthsthe return period for this phone has passed so i guess im stuck with a very new nonfunctional phonethis sucksblu offers a cheaper alternative to the more pricy android phones but if you want your  worth i urge you not to make the same mistake and buy this phone,neutral

i purchased this phone in may  and really liked the features of this phone the keyboard clear screen ability to get an additional battery additional memory chip and small size i was able to use this phone for work and personal email without major problems for about a year unfortunately about thirteen months after i got the e it started rebooting randomly finally last month on a business trip to san diego it began to reboot constantly rendering it virtually unusable i tried reseting the device without any change i looked up some posts on the internets and some thought it was related to the att network in certain areas perhaps it was a conflict with my jawbone bluetooth or other software i had installed regardless i could no longer depend on the phone since i will be working quite a bit in the san diego area so i joined the rest of my family and switched over to the iphone ,neutral

in theory i love this phone the functionality the set up the ease of use i do i love it the stylus for note taking is a particular favorite feature for a nerd like me i can jot down a note without looking at a keyboard or opening an app super handy in dark rooms while listening to nerdssaid with love talk about stuffhowever this version is not awesome not realizing i was purchasing an international version for use in the us was my fault admittedly there is a us adapter for the european plug that comes with the phone which is handy if i do travel internationally in the next little while it shall  it will be handy to not need to worry about the converter i guessexcept for the fact that i never have service anywhere the phone just cannot manage to have more than two measly bars of service at most and even then does not always actually send calls through after digging through the specifications deeper today after purchasing several months ago i realized that even though it says it services t mobile it does not actually fully support t mobile im guessing this is the issue because my kid with a different phone than me has no issue with service when in the same locationi would not even notice if i could connect to wifi calling but i cannot there is no option not for this version even better the phone has a sense of when a call is super important and that has  that is when it decides it does not have enough connectivity to ring through im not sure what sort of voodoo that is but it has  it is frustrating as all hell client call straight to voicemail kid puking their guts out and have a broken arm at school rough recess right straight to voicemail text from that super cute guy i was hoping to see that comes through but only after enough delay that the order of texts mess up my clearly clever intent and now just make me look like a dork to be fair it does not take too much voodoo for thati do somehow manage to get every sales call though yup voodooi do not know if there is a fix to this maybe it has  it is just the universe telling me to move to belgium how does this model perform in belgium no idea but it has  it is got to be better than hereso if you have t mobile do not buy this phone,neutral

the phone is nice looking and lightweight but a bit laggy and has a mediocre camera battery life is also not the best my previous phone was moto g and it beats huawei p in all aspects the only advantage of huawei is dual sim support but the funny thing is that if you use two sims you cannot insert a memory card if you are looking for a  phone i would recommend taking a look at moto g which should be even better than g instead of this one,neutral

phone looks good  but the battery cover is warp so it do not set right worry water will get inside i tryed to replace it i called samsung  they dont sell them at the sametime i found out that original it was a gray active phone they replace it with a blue color shell but others then that is seems to work good so far,neutral

the item did not meet my expectations when i started using the phone the maximum calls i could make was  and the battery will die i emailed the supplier and he sent me a new battery for free yet the problem still exist the item is nothing good to talk about but the supplier is one of the best to deal with,neutral

i purchased this unlocked phone because i had been disappointed with a replacement sent to me by att the phone seemed to have the features i was after and it did i liked it for the most part after only a few weeks the coating on the  external buttons began peeling off this is no big deal as it does not at all effect the usability of the phone just looks bad after four months of use the screen and buttons both began not working the phone is under warranty and has been sent back for a repairreplacement the company seemed to be easy to work with so far but we will see it seemed like four months was not long to last so i fear that the replacement will probably only last till around the end of the warranty period for the money spent i expected a phone that would last a couple years if taken care of and it was taken care of it had never been droppedor gotten wet and had a good screen protector installed on the day it arrived to me i will update this review as i get the replacement and see how it holds upupdatewell the service was fine got the phone back in a reasonable amount of time and it had been repaired it seemed fine and worked for another few months again it stopped working still under warranty so i sent it off again the company again has been good in that it has sent me a new phone i just feel like there is no way the phone will last past the end of the warranty i still like the phone but the quality is obviously not there,neutral

this phone does its job decently enough but the fact that i bought a  gb memory card for it and i cannot use it to save apps really puts it down a few pegs i can use it for music not for the walkman app that comes preloaded and for other apps that keep data aside from their executables other than that it has  it is a fine cheap phone that works for me just fine over in new zealand ive had it for about two months now and it has  it is holding up in all other capacities,neutral
the quality is poor the sound is very low it does not have enough functions to make configuration only has k of memory and it not be able to save anything i not recommend it,neutral

update  i am returning my blu phone for reasons listed in the bad part of my review also uploaded pictures of performance testing and error messagesupdate  blu has been promising an android kitkat software update for months and have missed every deadline they set today i read an interview on androidguys where the ceo samuel ohevzion said that if you want the latest operating system that they had promised you should sell your old phone and buy a new one with that software i think that is horrible servicegoodits decently priced and has a big bright display it does offer dual sims although they do not really work supports multiple gsm frequencies of  mhz and hsdpa  mhzmediocrei bought this phone because i was impressed with its specs when i started using it i noticed it lagged anywhere it needed graphics even simple video games with d graphics would freeze i downloaded antutu which is an app that tests all aspects of the phone and tried it outi was really surprised to find that the blu life one x was slower than a nexus  and even slower than a samsung galaxy  basically the blue one x has better hardware but the older phones work much better i did some research and found out its because blu uses cheap memory which perform horribly the ram where android operating system runs and flash storage where pics and apps are stored run about the same speed as phones that came out  years agobadoccasionally when i try to make calls i get a message that says call not sent no valid number entered and i have to try  or  times before it will dial throughthe gps only works about  of the time and often takes several minutes to lock doing a side by side comparison with google maps and waze using the blue one x a samsung galaxy  and a nexus  the blue one x was always the last phone to lock into gps and find streets correct it often took twice as long as the other phonesanother issue is that blu uses a different address book and dialer than the standard android os this causes it not to sync well with things like google voice or google address book or viberdual sims i have multiple sims cards so i tried out the dual sim feature tmobile in the  slot and att in the number  slot so far i have not been able to dial out at all using att when both slots are full if att is the only sim in the phone works fine put tmobile back in and no matter what i try i cannot make calls using attdata through the dual sims is a bit of a hassle it takes nine clicks to switch between data services and then you have to wait about  for the transfer to completelastly even though blu promised an android update months ago this phone is still running android  blus ceo was quoted in an interview that if people want the newest version of android they should buy a new phonesummary do not buy this phone for the dual sim that feature does not work blu has not updated the phone once as promised and likely will not provide regular updates the specs are misleading and this phone performs poorly if you want an inexpensive phone that performs well and gets regular updates there are many better choices used samsung galaxy  or nexus  both cost less and are faster work better have newer versions of android,neutral

i have no doubt this case offers great protection and at the time of this writing the price is very reasonable as cases go if you take your note on the go and do not rely too much on the s pen this will work great i ordered this from breed and it shipped right away and arrived in great conditionhowever be aware that the defender series cases have a builtin screen protector which is not removable through normal means at least this brings me to my big complaint with this product it does not play nice with the s pen yes you can technically use it but you lose the benefits pressure sensitivity is significantly harder to control and the protector creates a lot of unnecessary friction to the point where drawing is actually a pretty squeaky affair drawing long lines is an absolute pain while you can adjust the sensitivity no matter what i tried it felt like i was using an ordinary capacitive stylus  either it has  it is on or off no inbetween if you are used to the slick drawing surface of the base tablet this will be a deal breakeri have an otterbox commuter on my note  phone and it works great but its screen protection is not builtin so the drawing experience is unchanged my positive experience with that case is what sold me on this onelastly it has  it is a pain to open this case the first time you do it all otterboxes have a similar design where you remove an outer silicone layer to reach the hard shell inside perhaps because this case is a few years old the silicone has hardened up a bit but i found it very difficult to remove the underlying hinges need some finessing too it gets much easier after the first attempt and i recommend steve taylors great video review here on amazon if you are confused bring some sharp fingernails andor a butter knife ,neutral

i just bought this phone last week on amazoncom and mainly purchased it because it seemed to be a decent basic cell phone when i went to verizon to activate it they told me that i could not use the prepaid basic cell phone plan for it the one that is  for everything unlimited i had to buy the smartphone package for either  or  because of the fact that it has an enhanced web browser if you check out the browser on this phone it is very limited and definitely does not seem enhanced not really sure why verizon thinks that this is a smartphone because it has  it is the dumbest smartphone ive ever seen i want a basic cell phone so i can just text and receive phone calls i do not care about the camera and im tired of spending a lot of  on monthly bills for the smartphone i have currently with att galaxy s so just a heads up if you buy this phone that you will have to buy the more expensive prepaid phone plan for it,neutral
i really like the phone looks great sound is great quick learning curve but the battery life sucks i put it on the charger before bed and it does not even completely charge after  hours of nonuse then the battery is almost dead after a couple of hours of nonuse off the charger not sure if it has  it is just a bad battery from the supplier or the design of the phone itselfnot sure why the first time i sent a review in it said a kids review im  years old update feb  the battery that came with the phone continued to get worst to the point that if i wanted to make a call that would last  mins or so i would have to plug it in and use it as a corded phone i picked up a battery at battery and the new battery works well but added another  dollars to the cost of the phone,neutral
ordered the phone on sunday received by thursday first the phone it has  it is a nice looking phone but that has  that is where it pretty much stops motorola is very behind on the features they offer for phones and the display has been the same for the past atleast  years since i had my first motorola the phones that offer the best features for wallpaper color schemes is lg there phone features are awesome now on cingular service this was my first time signing up when i first got the phone i kept getting unregestired sim called the first lady said the phone was defective so i contacted amazona new phone is on the way called cingular again another lady said it could be the phone or sim card happened to come on here and read reviews and saw where someone else had the same problem he said he contact cingular tech support and they were able to help i called and spoke with someone and tech supportthanks it workedkinda anyway the tech support person said they where having problems with there towers that the werent regesiter new customersmakes no since to me anyway she said i would need to keep turning my phone on and off until it picks it upwell eventually that worked but i cannot believe you would have to go through all that with a cell phone company just to get to servicethat sucks big time i had tmobile before and compared to the problems i had with them they do not even compare to the problems ive had with cingular for just a day of service so all in all i would just get the silver razr through tmobile and only have a  year contract as oppossed to a  year contract wcingular i still have about  or so more days before i decide if i want to stick with cingular or kick them to the curb,neutral

this is a nice inexpensive smartish watch i have an iphone s plus and after some trial and error i finally got it paired with my phone the display is nice and it has multiple analog faces to choose from because it is round you cannot read all of the information that appears at the top of the screen the pedometer did not match my phones pedometer which i kept in my pocket all day the sound quality is good but not loud unless it is ringing and you cannot turn that down also all of my apps now play sound solely through the watch which i do not like i did like how i got text notifications even if i could not reply to them my problem with siri is it only wants to call my phone so over all not bad for the price i guess but i am sending it back for those glitches mentioned above,neutral

one of the phones is usable but we cannot use the camera or the voice mail because the previous owner had a password and we have no way to know what it is we can make calls but that is all the other phone had to be returned because it was locked with a password from the previous owner and there is no way to unlock it i even paid for an unlock code and called att and they could not unlock it i am not very satisfied thank you,neutral
i gave it  stars because it could go either way there are two ways to look at this phone one of the coolest most featureloaded phones for the price a supercheap deal on an advanced smartphoneif you are in category  this phone will be awesome you will not find a touchscreen phone any cheaper and this one also has some fancy organizer features good volume a handy set of customizable shortcut bars and a menu system which allows you to filter which kind of menu options are displayed the onscreen keyboard system works pretty wellhowever if you are in category  this will be a very disappointing substitute for other phones which cost as much as the as original price the menu is slow and many submenus require several seconds of a processing icon before they will open the web browser is slow even for edge it can only run one java application at once you will be prompted to close one if you open another the email client has no autoconnect options at all for such an apparentlyslow processor i could not find any official rating but menu response is slow it does not have very good battery life normally the upside to slow phones it also cannot run opera mini v  works which most of my older phones handle okand one big problem if you want this specific phone for advanced uses it either does not have any security certificates included or at least not any common certificates i could not find a way to view the list but it fails either way this can cause problems trying to establish secure email connections which makes the builtin email client useless unless you want to pass on security the phone also has problems with signed java applications so i can only install the unsigned version of opera mini and then the phone has the nerve to warn me that it is unsigned every time i use it this is the second secondarymarket motorola i have tried these phones are new but were probably overstock reflashed to unbranded or us firmware which had this issuethe bottom line is do not get this thinking it is an amazing deal on a highend phone because the ultimate functionality is more like an average phone plus the touchscreen interface but if you have a fixed budget of a hundred bucks for any kind of phone at all this is a very cool alternative to newer phones in that price range which will truly be entrylevelif for some reason you need a more advanced phone for a similar price try one of the lowpriced samsung blackjack models currently available you will have to be ok with the rather unpleasant windows mobile platform and lose the touchscreen but it will be able to handle things the a fumbles withupdatei was originally going to keep this phone as a spare or physical labor phone when i do not want to risk my good ones since it is so cheap but now even opera will not run the popup to allow internet access freezes up and nothing works i have to reboot to shut down the program and even then it does not always work reinstalling opera or gmail works for a while but that is too annoyingupdate onewebmall is a scam website which steals reviews i wrote this review for amazon not some internet leach which steals reviews to get high search engine rankings,neutral

i have been using this watch for a month and i really enjoy using it when it is working properly i will start with the positivesfirst off the look and build quality is amazing its sturdy sheek and is clean enough to wear with any type of attire ive worn it to work and i have worn it with a full suit people stop me and ask me about everytime they see itthe battery is great so far it lasts all day without a problemthe sound on it when it comes to music and media is very good loud and clear without the tinny sound as expected of something with speakers as small as thesethe price is awesome you wont get a watch at this price with such a sturdy buildbut the negatives have to be addressed as well the connectivity is probably my biggest issue with the watch i will have it on and constantly have to re connect it to my phone every  minutes or so i could be in a phone call and it would just disconnect even with the batteries on both devices at a high percentagethe time zone is also an issue its always an hour ahead cannot figure out why i have to constantly go into my watch everytime to fix the time because the watch uses something called a live zone and when you first set it i set it to my home state but every time i turn the watch off and on it will change my zone an hour ahead went out west for a week on business and it changed the zone to where i was but changed to an hour ahead anyway its hard to really explain but its really annoying to say the leasteven tho the media sounds amazing on this watch calls only sound as amazing when u are in a dead quiet setting having it in the car was ideal but even the slight road noise made the call hard to hear windows closed radio off air conditioning off and i still could not have a continuous conversation in my home is great thoughscreen is small so texting should he kept at very short phrases having a conversation via text on ur watch will take a while it took me  attempts to type the word congratulations slightly frustratingi like the watch enough to keep wearing it and using some of the functions like the alarm music pedometer and for the look but if the issues with time wasnt so annoying this would have gotten  stars and if i didnt have to connect it to my phone so often  starsi will not say that you shouldnt try it out some reviews on this are awesome and most likely my situation is not a common one,neutral

i love my cell then  months later it has decided to stop charging seems the charger port is lacking big time with this model from what i read now it was very hard to find anyone to even work on my cell given that the brand is blu once i did finally find someone it was going to have to be mailed in because i live to far way from them when its all said and done it will cost  just to fix and mail it back i love the cell but with that price to fix it it does not seem worth it,neutral

i really like this cellphone because it has no big cons first i start with the pros it has  it is really new quite stable build you probably can removereattach the backside for inserting a sim card which is important if you use as backup bright screen  good visibility even in sunlight very fast considering the ghz dualcore apart from gaming low power consumption and therefore battery life seems to be ok has most features of a modern cellphone frontrear cam flash gps hspa most of the other sensors as well dual sim sd card expansion have no app found which is not working properly so far except antutu noled app also working and not overheatingcons very slippery back and no covers available on amazon was not able to run antutu benchmark  app failed  maybe not enough memory only  gb space available  gb is used from system some bloatware preinstalled  most of them nonremovable camera  pictures quite dark blurry sometimes almost no color next to useless backside very hard to open very slowly charging still on android  and no update in sight i guess it will never come no front led for alerting after a few days i recognized that speakers are not very loud hence i missed  of the calls which is very bad  as well as it has  it is quite hard to understand the counterparty even my very cheap headset is much better im really close to give it backi bought it as a backup but not sure if i will keep,neutral

i like everything about this phone however i feel a few things are not quite as good as others have statedat least not for me for instance the battery life is supposed to last about  days or at least  hours if being used but i have not come anywhere close to that i was excited to start using the phone on wireless connection and downloaded a few games to play the play time was only about  hours of constant playing also there were quite a few times where the games would skip momentarily the games did not crash but it was quite annoyingi did a factory reset on my phone to try and see if i could get more battery life but it did not make any difference i have to admit that the battery life was the main thing that attracted me to this phone so i am disappointed i bought  of these phones and both are the same so i doubt that i just got a bad one i should mention that i thought i read that the recharge time is supposed to be awesomesomething like  charge in  mins not sure exactly but i did not see that recharge speed eitheron a side note this phone is very easy to use and i really like the emotion ui a lot there are custom uis out there to make this phone operate similar to a lot of other android uis but the stock one is awesome to me also i read step by step instructions on how to load custom mods and how to unlock the bootloader there are a lot of videos on youtube but they are all pretty much consolidated on xda developers website along with information about other phones too this is a developer website so they are helpful as well if you choose to explore that sort of stuff i was told by one person there this phone was among their top  phones for everyday usei did a little bit more research online and found a youtube video showing how to replace the battery but all the reviews lead me to believe that the battery was not replaceable after watching the video however it seems fairly easy to replace it if you are patient and work carefullyreally the only major complaint i have is the battery life not living up to what was advertised although  hours of constant use really is not too bad therefore i thought  stars was fair considering that the battery life was one of the major reasons i chose this phone to begin with i may update this review after a little more time with this phone,neutral

for the price it should be a great value i commend blu for offering a phone at this price point i really wanted to see a low cost option initially my review was one star but i am now changing it to  starsi ignored the one star reviews about phone rebooting itself constantly when i first got it that has  that is all it did with the att sim in the phone it could not charge because it rebooted constantlyas for att i tried two sims ensured the right imei number was registered remember this has two sim capability so there are two imei numbers at the att store we gave up as wellto save you some hassle here are some tips tech support requires an enormous amount of personal information which is not necessary to troubleshoot this problem i can understand email address maybe a first and last name but why do you need my cell phone number when any contact info would suffice in case we get disconnected you are not marketing stick to troubleshooting my problem troubleshooting is simply nothing more than doing a hard reset instructions available on the web by the way a hard reset through the settings did not work for me technical support did offer an alternative method below however i have  other windows phones and i knew tech supports instructions were wrong key sequence i also did not receive their email for whatever reasonst way to resetgo to settings about scroll down to reset your phone easieroruse the key sequences belowmake sure your phone is offpress and hold volume down button then power button togetherthe moment it vibrates release the power button till an exclamation sign appearsnow release the volume down buttonnow enter the following sequence within a second or two of each otherpress volume up buttonpress volume down buttonpress power buttonpress volume down buttonphone rebootsif you see spinning gears you have done it correctly if not you screwed something up start the sequence again or do it the easy way above i was ready to ship this back after doing a hard reset easy way twice and hard way once for some reason i decided to uncheck g under cellular the moment i did that it connected to att and all was well or it was just a coincidence maybe i had to hard reset  times i checked g once again and all is well maybe att issue not accepting a g connection or just a coincidencethe phone also updated twice during the process by the way so i have the latest  release note the hard reset does not revert back to previous os versions so that has  that is good news it just cleans the databottom line i should not have to do all this but if your phone reboots and you still want to keep it hope this reviewtroubleshooting helpsif your phone works out of the box you were luckier than inow the phone has been working for  hours with no problems i desperately need a storage card as my daughter already decided to load gb of apps on it so mb available oops if the phone is dependable i will up the stars to  or even  due to its valueas for windows os i like it but this review is for the phone onlyupdate  phone is now rebooting on its own and inoperable for the most part i tried a hard reset but screen freezes it reboots it has  it is a mess still under warranty note you must pay for shipping and it takes  days for blu to assess and give you options will update but that has  that is a long time without a phone so it has  it is a bummer that they do not cross shipupdate  they sent me a refurbished phone took about  weeks for the end to end exchange seems to be working ok,neutral

excellent phone for the buck purchased for fil who will take back and use in india blr specification as per guidance more than sufficient for his usage excellent camera was his primary usage including bonus front flash feature for great selfieshowever cavet warning i used this for a week to test it out in the central new jersey region i have tmobile coverage data speeds you will only get is g this is not g and definitely not lte difference is huge compared to the my other phones voice quality is very good that does not affect the coverage but if you are heavy on skype or youtube using your carrier data plan you will notice the lagalso have found out that once he takes it back to india airtel and most of the mobile provides are on different bands which means the best you could get would be g in india not a dealbreaker for my fil as he has  he is usually going to connect via wifi but fair warning to purchasers who think it data would be fast in other countries or even in the usspeaker phonelistening to music is also not great as the sound on max is low using mx player app helps to alleviate the problem where it artificially boost the volumeoverall snappy emails functioned great and speed was very good android v is also nice with few nifty feature improvements if it was not for the data speed and volume i would have bought a nd one for myself because i feel in love with the screen size,neutral

the g play is a good phone well deserving of it has  it is stature amongst the latest highend budget smartphones however what truly irks me is that amazon has gone out of their way to make their exclusive version unrootable let alone provide an option to pay for the advertisements on the lockscreen and notifications to be removed i do not mind the bloatware i do not mind amazon using said bloatware as a mode of making the phone cheaper through product placement what i do mind is very anticonsumer acts such as this  which infuriates me and makes me question if i should be constantly supporting amazon through paying for prime and still using their site if amazon has any good will left in them something shocking to expect from a corporation in this day and age id advise that if not now than  months from now they authorize motorola to release the bootloader unlock codes once the phone is out of relevance and in turn is not turning much of a profit  this could breathe new life into the device allowing further sales from a now unlocked device the bootloader is code that is part of a computer that allows the computerdevice to boot into a operating system android oses have their own bootloader which is sometimes locked mind amazon given hard work time and dedication such codes can be cracked by hackers this was done before with motorolas phones andor done now  amazon can provide an option for you to pay  dollars or the sort to allow you to disarm the amazon deals app built into the lockscreen and notificationsuntil amazon does so i cannot recommend the amazonexclusive version it is too locked for my good and much to my chagrin i am stuck with it if you do not mind spending  extra dollars then the fully unlocked nonamazon g play is a good choice for a phonedo yourself a favor and do not fall for the same mistake that i did,neutral
good but inside component are exposed such that u are likely to break off any component when inserting the sd if not careful enough this happened to me and i just discovered one tiny component broken because they were not protected or not built away from the sd insert pathwaythese smart watch only read or accepts the  gig sized sd cards as its maximum limitalso it does not play music over bluetooth headset you cannot play your music files through the audio player but through file manger the music audio playback does not play continuously or next audio filethe audio playback stops when u want to use other function,neutral

the motorola motofone f is a basic nofills cell phone that has  that is unique for it has  it is usage of an eink display same technology used in ebook readers like the nook or kindle the benefits of having this type of display is that it uses less power looks like printed text on paper readable under direct sunlight and offers extensive durability for these reasons the f has been labeled by some as the zombie accomplice emergency phonehowever in practice i found that eink the biggest selling point of the f can also be a hindrance for example to refresh the display for menus text messages there is a notable lag and a flicker used to wipe the screen and create the new image  which can slow users down also i found the battery life to be quite disappointing seeing that the phone had an eink screen no camera no bluetooth no games only for calling and mms i was surprised to find the phone to only last roughly  days under moderate usagecall quality itself is quite good and the reception with tmobiles g network is more than acceptablenote that this is a dual band not quad band phone which means some countries may not support the device reception and battery info are both smartly displayed on the upper region of the display next to the earpiece to both sides what has  what is not so smart though is the ui it has  it is slightly clunky and takes some time to learn all the icons and tricks there has  there is also no volume rocker so changing the sound midcall is more tedious than on normal phonesotherwise the backlight is readable in the dark and the keypad is largetactile to press the phone is also quite lightweight and slim making it easy to carry along with you again in therms of aesthetic appeal this is definitely a very eyecatching design despite being made out of plasticoverall the low price tag under  unlocked cuttingedge look cool eink screen and good call quality compensate for the disappointing battery life and lack of more features if you do want a basic or emergency backup phone with plenty of style go for it just note it has  it is shortcomings as well,neutral

the phone itself compared to any other for the purpose of reception sound and phone storage is not that goodfor games pretty good unfortunately most games involve touch screen operation so the control itself is redundant at timesi have not really spent much time looking for games that work with the slideout pad as i got the phone for my kids to play withall in all this phone is a novelty and was only made by apple and verizon for a few years because of it probablykinda cool though you can most likely find this phone used for  bucks where a psvita or ds will run you  used and have a much faster wifi and internet process speed larger and clearer display i do not know do the math,neutral

this is my first smartphone and although i know their battery life is much shorter than other cell phones the battery went down  after watching one fiveminute video i contacted the seller if this was an issue with the phone itself but they sent me an extra battery instead of actually telling me what was wrong which i thought was ok at the time but the newer battery depletes even faster than the one before and i have to charge it every few hours so it will not die ive also noticed that the phone probably mine in particular will not allow me to use the finger scan to unlock it saying an error has occurred if this continues to occur turn off and on the phone and try again or something like thatoverall for the refurbished version it works alright and is cosmetically fine,neutral

cons its okay phone however not seeing the long battery life it claimed to provide this is main reason i picked this phone for my son the prenstalled apps make it hard to set the display for your own personal needs it does not allow you to delete some apps already on the display these apps are something my son would never use it really takes away the hold ideal of having an unlocked phone if my son did not really need a phone right now i would probably send it back its kind of thick for its size but that has  that is because of the battery that has  that is being used i did expect that as a needed measure i have used it to charge another phone yet so cannot comment on that featurepros the phone looks good in person so far it seems to load apps and surf the web okay the camera takes reasonable pictures these is an editing option which allows you to change the picture somewhat,neutral

i loved the idea of having a smart watch ive been looking for one for a while and i was not willing to pay  for the samsung gear it did not come with any directions per say so you just have to wing it on operation use set up of course is touch screen it took me a little while to figure out that you can swipe through the main screens when you want to dial out the numbers are not  am not all that easy to push so you may find yourself having to redail the numbers a few times the volume is kind of low i wish it was louder so when driving i could hear the person clearer however ive been told that i can be heard just fine playing music is fine since it connects right through my phone it does not have a camera you cannot verbally write your text messages and i still have not completely figured out how to add numbers to the phone book all in all its actually a pretty good watch for the price play around with the watch for awhile you shall  you will eventually love it the inside of the band is completely rubber and i do not sweat which is good it looks exactly the same as it does in the pictures,neutral

this phone is amazing when it comes to the amount of processing speed and battery life it has a satisfying weight to it and it relatively slim with the size of the battery however do not over charge this battery because it has  it is effiency will drain drastically and you will not have the same life span as you would expect it also overheats very quickly if held on your person for too long and often restarts unexpectedly when the processor is overloaded but it is rare but it is something to look out for when using the phone it is also only six compatible with  degree angled jacks which was weird but it has  it is still a great phone with optimal size but i wish i had chosen another product from blu that performs better than before,neutral

ive never purchased a grey market phone in my life so in all honesty i was not entirely certain what to expect well heres the deal i thought this phone was going to be everything and more than i expected and for the most part it is yes it works flawlessly on att just as long as you do not care about having a g lte experience at best you shall  you will get h speedson the upside not only is this a factory unlocked international version of the lumia  it comes without the crippling limitations found in the att variantspecifically this phone comes with  gb internal storage double the capacity found in att retail stores the phone also includes qi wireless charging which was notoriously removed by att from their version of the phone throw in a secure nanosim and high capacity microsd expansion and the phone has all the capabilities of even the most powerful smartphones on the market except for that pesky absence of g lte in the uson the downside did i mention this specific device does not include the lte bands used by us carriers that has  that is a deal breaker for me and so im returning the device the seller really should explain in plain text in the description that this is the international version and will not receive g lte data service for this reason i have knocked the item down to  stars otherwise it would have been  starsthe lumia  is a remarkable device yes it is large but remarkably light it does take some getting used to but once you have seen the stunning photos and incredibly smooth experience of windows phone  with the cyan firmware it more than makes up for any uncertainties i had about going with such a large phone that said if you are in the usa this is probably not the phone you want to purchase look for a lumia  model rm or rm instead,neutral
loved it when i got it but within  months it had stretched out  is gaping at the corners i only removed it once to clean my screen since debris  moisture gets under the screen protector now it barely fits i expected better of an ottorbox not sure id buy another one,neutral

hardware is fine phone is responsive and i have not encountered lag it replaced honor x just a word of caution  if you intend to use a third party launcher ive tried google nova apex z launcher arrow and a few others you will not be able to add widgets it will error out other cons  no led notifications of any kind  not just for message a but also for charging no way to enter a message of the type if you find this phone email so and so on the locked screen since according to my research it seems that blu rarely if ever bothers with firmware updates i am contemplating returning it it has  it is a shame since otherwise it looks like a really nice phone,neutral

after few months i think im able to provide a fair review about this phone huawei made a good well product with a premium feeling just the plastic rim i do not really likethe screen is pretty big and i love it the screens quality is quite good but not exceptional the camera is correct but could be faster and betterthe phone should definitely have more ram because it is suffer with multitaskingthe best thing with this phone is when it comes to talk about the battery the battery is simply phenomenal just the best far away battery i ever had even with an intense use of this phone the battery can take more than one daybut the worst thing is probably the software there is some very silly bug and since huawei still did no update to fix at least some of those bug and this is really unnaceptable for a company who pretend to make premium phone at this time im still waiting for lolippop updateactually the only one reason why i kept this phone is the battery and the large screen,neutral

while the specs look good in papertheory the real life performance was disappointing camera first let down was the camera it is hard to believe the megapixel count on the camera all the pics i took exhibited water color effect with lack of detail oversaturation with hdr the front camera took selfies which are grainy even the video quality was quite bad check the camera reviews on c or m the samsung s camera is better than this screen nd let down is the screen i may be spoiled by samsung previous phone was a s edge which i dropped and damaged but the colors are very washed out the brightness is not enough for use in sunlight here in dallas texas i have liked lg g g moto x pure screens not that i am completely partial to samsung but this screen is pure bad even blu phones have better display go to bestbuy and check out the c display you will know performance with sd  processor and  gigs of ram did not experience any abnormal heating issue while using gps etc did get a little warm and the glass back made it hard to hold but not a problem if you have a case or lags the sony ui is very clean and close to stock android software upgraded to android  and there was no root available for it on xda battery life battery life was good to ok better than s edge but not as good as the s active little less than a note  or nexus pfeatures that are unique that made me buy this phone dual sim gb ram sd waterproofnfc  inch p screen  mpx camerabut the screen and camera alone was a bummer with this phone there is no wow factor like when i got when i bough the s edge,neutral

this is a great battery i wish they put a little more phone on it though for the most part it is a very nice device however everything happens in slow motion and lots of apps have bugs youtube randomly will not play videos messaging apps freeze up ect the data also cuts in and out in a very odd fashion seems to get good reception however sometimes the phone just refuses to send or receive any data for  seconds this probably happens  times a day at the worst possible times i have not decided yet however i will probably return it,neutral

i like the fact of the bp has the capabilities it states now for a few reasons i am at a disappointed reviewing first off i do not know exactly of this may been my fault or what but looking at the time and placing back in pocket should not trigger the factory reset setting so what ever i had been working on sites documents wiped without my knowingness second i really hate google and i did not know this is also heavily based on big brother google last on the list also a major problem for me is watching china as they desecrate every thing they touch from poisonous products tainted consumables intellectual theft rapid growth in military always having some new strain of viruses a culture that has  that is beyond rude self centered and dirty topped off with possession of stolen government defense technology and security clearances the swiss company out of all places to make a phone of this nature why pick china that leads me to one last thing so it being made in china with their unregulated work ethics is this bp really as secure as they say it is,neutral

i gave this phone  stars because im not quite sure if it was defective or if it was just a bad phone first off it was not capable of taking pictures i know that international versions of phones are not  am not capable of mms in the us but this phone was not capable of saving pictures either again i sent my phone back and did not request a replacement so i am still unsure to whether it was maybe just defective also the touchscreen was extremely hard to use even with the included stylus the sensitivity of the touchscreen is probably the deal breaker for me the features on the phone are great it has  it is powered by windows so you get the use of word excel powerpoint and other ms office software the phone was extremely easy to navigate and it was easy to organize and close windowsapplications because of the drop down menu also new emails and texts were displayed right on the home screen so there has  there is no need to check periodically overall i really like this phone except for the touchscreen and its inability to take pictures,neutral

i purchased this to use in the us and ended up returning it it has  it is a gorgeous phone but if you are thinking about using this in the us save yourself the time and money and get an unlocked att version which has lte bands that work in the us and also bands  and  which should work abroad as wellthe phone is received was the hong kong version because of that the emergency call button on the lock screenyou cannot remove itis preset to call the hong kong emergency system number  so that function is basically useless to you if your national emergency number is different also the dual sim status is notated on your lock screen i had my sim in the main slot and the nd sim empty so i constantly had scrolling test on the lockscreen saying that sim  was empty this was just a minor annoyanceoverall the phone itself is great just be aware that this does not support lte in the us or canada,neutral

it does the job but using the camera or the internet will eat up your minutes and the battery will drain as fast the camera has a delay and so the pictures do not come out good if you want a phone just for texting and occasional calling get a basic phone especially if you are going to use it in the phils i was only there for a week but i must have spent over a thousand pesos for loads for reasons i cannot understand i barely even used it to call just texting i also noticed that if i use the internet my minutes disappeared like crazy it could have been too that i was a victim of loadsnatching which is very rampant in the phils i found out about it too late,neutral
i just got this ci er yesterday i am very mobile with my job and use of phone it was easy to put on my samsung  love how it protects the phone and still fits in back pocket for work i keep it in my work bag buttons work great no problems pressing them or controlling them like other covers the only thing i am disappointed in is that the material it has  it is made of is very sensitive to fading and scratches i have only had it less than  hours and it has a spot where color wore off i do not even know how that possibly got there since i only started using git this morning and it was only in my bag securely put away i have seen my sons otter box color black quickly faded or essentially color rubbed off from any type of friction soft or hard i am big on esthetics so i am going to have to return the way it seems it will most likely fade in color completely in less than a month too bad i love the fit and color purple with pink trim,neutral
the battery on this phone is almost nonexistent i like all of the features but if you use any of them it drains half your battery life and that includes a  second phone call ive done all the battery saving tricks and nothing has worked maybe i just have a bad battery,neutral
got this to complete a working scale model office the little phone actually has a pretty accurate touch screen if i can get my fat fingers to hit only one of those little tiny keys on the keyboard probably not bad as a phone for someone with a kids handsi cannot say that im disappointed because i got yellow and that has  that is what i wanted but the only color they had in stock was green and i got yellow so drop one star also when i went to put the battery in i discovered this phone is not rugged the battery cover simply snaps on with no seals to protect against water splashes so minus another starall in all its not bad for a  smartphone that will not take up much space in the tankbag of your motorbike or in your hiking bag but keep it in a zip top bag if you have a bluetooth keyboard and mouse or can vnc into it like i did it will be a lot easier to set up,neutral

i loved this phone when i first got it an unlocked phone for the priceperformance ratio i got it for was totally worth the price its too bad i had to latch onto a company not dedicated to upgrading android on all their capable devicesprosnice style and screen sizescreen can get very bright for outdoor usevery functional and has an mini sd slot removable battery which is not as common as it should bedid not expect it to run heavy games but runs lighter d games and d games well which is all i need for a phonetwo sim card spots in case you travel a lot and compatible with my carrier after some tweaking of settings net battery lasts through the day without heavy use can carry two or a charger if you need toconsno kit kat even though it should be fully capable of running italthough it can get bright which is good it cannot get dark enough for some nighttime bedroom reading lowest brightness not dim enoughsometimes has trouble with installing appsaudio and video could be betterive learned megapixels do not equate to better pictures mp can mean a high resolution blurry picture its a phone so dont expect great pictures no matter what number they slap on itlimited casesaccessories for this phone compared to better known brands like samsung and applethis phone will last me for at least a year or two but ill always wonder if it would have been worth it to pay a bit extra for a name brand phone the internals are solid and it works for the price but my expectations were still not met i would not recommend the brand blu even though this phone is mechanically sound simply because their dedication to software is much poorer than other companies,neutral
i got this phone for my grandgirl and no contract required its not activated yet but i wanted to share my thoughts its not an expensive phonebut its a cute phone and if she losses it or it goes thru the washing machine it wont be a big loss now keep in mind its small for small hands its about   wide and about  inches tall she will love it and i will be glad she has a phone on her at all timesi dont know if i can buy a screen  and cover for this one or not but will seewe live in the usa and it came in english so no issues there changing it to english plus she can download her songs on here as well  i will update after its activiated if your looking for a phone that wont bust your wallet no contracts required has accress to the net mp and fm radio go for it im glad i did,neutral

received the phone in april and thought it was the the best affordable  phone on the market i was comparing the style the vivid screen and picture quality to an iphone little did i know that the phone would began to crap out on me ive had the phone for five months now and it suddenly started randomly powering off by itself and taking a least a minute or two to repower the phone went from that issue to now suddenly the camera will not work ive tried all the troubleshooting i know of and even contacted the blu brand they inform me that it has  it is technically nothing they can fix just return the phone back to the manufacture and they will try to fix it meanwhile i would be left with no phone in process not even a loaner phone fyi probably will never buy blu brand again even though their phones are beautiful stylish and vivid color screens the internal quality is not up to par buyer beware,neutral

positive side i ordered the phone on january  in the evening and i received it in florida today january  the estimated delivery time was between tuesday january   and wednesday february  so this was a good surprise the phone looks ok i still need to test its proper functioning over a long period but all looks fine to me so farnegative side the instructions book cover is in french however because i speak and read french this was of no problem to me but the instructions are in german  no french and no english and i do not speak nor write german i downloaded the instructions from the web this german instructions booklet with a french cover is odd i would like to make sense out of it i found no list of the parts included in the package there may be some parts missing but i would not know it an exhaustive list is only standard for any phone one of the plastic wraps containing small parts was visibly torn open there may have been some tampering and some parts missing how do i know i was expecting a  gb sd card included as described on the gsmarena dot com website their description concerns the us market there is none so it may be missing but i would not know since there is no list of the included parts samsung typically includes a small sd memory anyhow this does not appear to be a phone initially destined for the us region features may be lesser i did not find a clear mention of the sellers company whereabouts in the package i find no mention of the warranty and no warranty card as is to be expected with a samsung phone a flyer was included in the package it mentions leave a positive feedback within  days of delivery to extend your warranty to  days i do not buy into that i realize that i was influenced in my choice of vendor by the positive reviews this may explain thatconclusionit has  it is too early to jump to a conclusion but i find these unprofessional practices not reassuring i have doubts as to whether my phone is a legit unlocked new phone and not a refurbished one or a manufacturers defective series the instruction manual in german with a french cover is a good indication it is this should be mentioned in the amazon product description,neutral

i purchased this phone with ho as my carrier and the phone did not have full functions  it would not send or receive pictures as part of the text messaging my carrier insisted that this was because it was a blu phone and that they have not been able to have a single one of these phones work i really like this phone it was very sharp looking the display was bright and colorful i really wanted it to work so this is just a heads up to ho users that there has  there is a good chance this phone will not work for youupdate after quite the process they were able to get the picture messages to work but it is still has some glitches just a couple other things to note this phone got pretty hot at the top of the phone where you would be holding it while talking the battery is located lower in the phone so i am not sure why this was happening maybe that explains why the phone is having issues also the charging port is pretty cheap the charger kept falling out if it was barely touched,neutral

this is a great phone it has a powerful processor and excellent build quality android  is nice as well and so is htcs sense ui the problem ive had is that there are numerous connectivity issues the phone would not connect to bluetooth wifi or even my cellular network from time to time it sporadically lost all connection i had to do  hard resets in  days just to get the phone to work ive never had to do that with my iphone i ended up returning it and am now waiting for the galaxy s to be released on att if you get a working phone you cannot go wrong with this buy but if you get a buggy one it will be annoying,neutral
wifi did not work on this phone it was not from a lack of trying i liked other features of this phone and that has  that is why i gave it a ,neutral
do not know if i shall be able to use it i have not been able to understand how to use it the instructions with it were not so i could understand how to use it they just told where everything on it was i would give instructions an f i used ear buds and then when i took them off i was told to put them back on and did not know how to make it the other way this is should to be a simple phone it may just be me but i hate to think what it would be like to get a much more expensive smart one so i am glad for what i do have,neutral
for the price you cannot beat processor slow at times battery drains fast otherwise excellent phone,neutral
did not have it too long because it kept turning off spontaneously because of battery overheating i did not want to try it again with a replacement so i sent it back,neutral
the phone is in good condition but the battery does not last more than an hour even if i am only using my headphones i had my first piece returned in few days and got a replacement which is  more than the first piece i still have the battery problem and have to shell out another  for a new battery for this phone  the battery indicator shows there is still  available but switches off automatically when it hits ,neutral
as with nearly all devices anymore there is always give and take to hit the price point you want you shall  you will sacrifice things like battery power screen size memory etc to save a few bucks this phone falls squarely into that category you shall  you will give up a few things in order to save a few dollars and with tons of other options out there you may end up wanting to save your money for something a little betterfirst when considering this phone you need to assess how you are going to be using it if you are an app person that loves to play games on your phone this phone is a little underpowered and sometimes can be laggy or choppy with apps power users who like to run several apps at once will also find the performance not what they had  they would like for users who like to stay up to date on facebook and play an occasional game here or there this phone probably would suit you nicelyon the plus side for phones in this price range is the screen it has  it is rather large and has modestly good resolution the resolution and viewing angles are enough to survive watching something on a flight or an occasional youtube video you will not find yourself wowed by the screen but you probably will not hate it eitheranother plus for this phone is that it comes remarkably free of preinstalled garbage that needlessly hogs your internal memory it comes with far less bloatware than my galaxy s and my asus zenfone have for comparisons sake there are a few apps but not manyon the downside and definitely where corners have been cut to bring down the price of this phone it does not take good pictures yes you can snap selfies and snapshots just fine you probably expect those kinds of photos to be average and they are if you are hoping to get a good photo that you could print out and hang on a wall you shall  you will never get one of those on this phonebattery power seemed adequate probably pretty good for a phone in this price range it has  it is not going to hold up in comparison to a lot of flagship namebrand phones but it has  it is no slouch either most users will get a full day out of it maybe more if you manage your apps and notificationswe had a fair amount of trouble getting this phone to work through straighttalk it took a few calls and days of fiddling with the apn settings to get full capabilities using an att sim card im not saying that this will be the experience for every user but just something to consider if you are not particularly techsavvy and you are looking to use this phone with that servicein summary if you are looking at this phone because you are on a budget and want something to get you through for a year or maybe even two this phone is not necessarily a bad choice you shall  you will probably even find yourself in love with it at first then the reality will set in as to why this phone is less than  if you have time to wait for the perfect phone and can stretch your budget out you shall  you will find lots of equal if not better options out there for a few dollars more,neutral
ive owned several different android phones by many different manufacturers and this was the most temperamental phone by far sometimes i would be doing something as simple as browsing a website in chrome and the phone would lock up and automatically reboot other times it would become unresponsive and then  seconds later it would come back to life this phone seemed to totally lock up on me almost once a week and it was never when i was doing anything that would be considered taxing on the system the boot sequence also has an annoying loud sound that you cannot turn off so if the phone locked up when you needed to be quiet you have to try and cover the speaker with your fingerthe touch screen also seems to ignore input randomly but i was also using the included screen protector so that may have contributedi seemed to totally lose reception with this phone way more frequently than with other phones one time i lost reception and could only get it back by rebooting the whole phonethe battery lasted me all day typically but just barelyit came with a case from the manufacturer but it does not even fit properly it is loose vertically so the phone slides about mm up and down just enough to be irritating how the original manufacturer cannot even create a properly fitting case for their own phone is baffling even cheap  iphone cases from the dollar store have always fit my iphones snuglythe best thing about the phone was the large screen combined with the thin and lightweight frameblu phones on paper seem like they should be pretty good but the finicky nature of the radios and touchscreen are something that bothered me too much,neutral

updated review i do like the asus zenfone  laser zekl overall but the wireless n failed to meet my expectation asus describes the zenfone zekl as fast as it is buttery smooth but they do not tell you it is single antennae ghz restricted to up to mbps only i opened a complaint with asus support and they offered an rma exchange but that would not resolve the issue as that is a limitation of the designseveral people responded to my original post saying that mbps wireless n is really fast please take a look at these routers and get an education on what wireless n really can do and before anyone complains i am not comparing this phone to a router  just referencing wireless n speed capabilities note that these are wireless n routers and not the even higher speed wireless ac these are dualband wireless n routers delivering both  ghz and  ghz concurrent bands up to  mbps and  mbps respectively yes you read it right  up to mbps on the ghz band alone while i do not expect the zenfone to give me that mbps or even the  that ghz n and many phones do support i did expect better than  from asus based on their reputation as a leader in wireless networking plus the advertising router references for up to mbps on supported wireless n devices asus rtnu asus rtnr linksys e v netgear wndr dlink dir,neutral

while i love love love the battery life on this phone i have a major issue with the storage even though i have my phone set to default everything to the sd card it does not and i am very limited to what i can download to my phone i have gb available currently on my sd card but cannot even update the apps i already have on my phone due to insufficient storage this is a major flaw that ive found no actual solution to the phone does have a decent camera is very easy to use and is sturdy it would have five star material if i did not have to constantly fight just to get a new app,neutral

rightfully i should probably give this product one star rather than three but im considering the possibility that i just got a defective cell i bought this as a cheap efficient way to make and receive important calls unfortunately its never worked out of the box the phone proved incapable of keeping a charge longer than one day whats more is that after a painstaking activation i say this because after registering the product on net s website the phone still didnt work i had to call net  from a land line so that a customer service representative could walk me through the process of putting in about  to  activation codes after this the phone couldnt receive a signal almost anywhere in a very few locations we were able to make calls but nowhere that it actually counted it wouldnt even work at our home whereas weve had att and verizon phones which work just fine after calling net  again the customer service representative deduced that the produce was defective and that they would send a new phone i was fine with this even putting aside that wed had the produce well over a month and never got to use it after repeating the home address to the representative three times he still got it wrong the package ended up at a fedex several miles away and they couldnt resend the package so i called net  yet again to explain the problem to them they said that theyd send another phone and never did instead they cancelled my service with them which is just fine as i wouldve done that anyway the bottom line is that i gave this item three stars out of grace i assume that if you get a working product there will be no problem but be forewarned that costumer service is terrible should you have an actual problem,neutral
i have the blue one my husband has the orange one i have to say buyer beware if you are after a certain color  these are day glo bright his orange phone which looks nice and muted in the picture online arrived as huntingvest orange it is so bright my phone is more of a robins egg blue but that has  that is ok fortunately my husband did not mind is dayglo phone his response was well at least i can see where i put itfor the handson usage it has  it is ok but it has its quirks for some reason it hesitates what seems like forever after i select the text app and try to send a message i have to continuously tap my finger on the type text message box to get it to respondhearing on it is not the best i have the incall volume all the way up and sometimes have trouble hearing my calls unless im in a quiet area if you are in an area any louder than a grocery store or watching a movie for example you may have some trouble it has a great loud ringtone thoughi wish i could completely turn off vibration i still get a vibration when i receive a text or when the phone is incall and it connects to the number you dialed even though i have vibration and haptic feedback turned off strange this might be user error but their manual does not specify very clearly if there is a way to completely turn off all vibration im not too bothered by it as im just using this strictly as a mobile phone and not an entertainment device if it goes off once in a while i will not die i do not have batteryspace hog apps such as facebook installed so my battery life is very good it can last two days before i have to charge itthe screen is hard to see sometimes you have to angle it this way or that way depending on what you are trying to doall in all it has  it is a solid phone and it has  it is good for the price i do not make many calls mainly just use it for texting once i find another phone that has  that is a little more user friendly with more options this phone will be my trusty backup device,neutral

phone worked almosy great for the first week with the exception that the screen sometimes did crazy things like start typing random characters and getting out of the apps i was using the touchscreen is not very good on these occasions i had to turn off the phone no matter what i was doing before other thant that about a week after i started using the phone i woke up one morning and it did not turn on i had to leave it charging the whole day for it to turn on this has happened several times since and i now have to soft reset it for it to turn back on all in all it is not a bad phone but maybe these are just defective this phone is nice but if you really want it buy it somewhere else where you can guarantee it will be of good quality,neutral

i bought this to replace my att s which was so bogged down by bloatware that the battery would not hold a charge for more than an hour the s mini has an amazing battery life by comparison and considerably less bloatware as no phone carrier has control of it this model was set up for the south african market and my wifes for the german with some guidance as to the settings they both work on the att network without problemhowever the h data connection is actually a tad slower than the ss g lte even with the sms significantly better processor and fewer programs in the background even the regular operating system is pokey,neutral

the android budget smartphone market is hot right however under  price point their are only a few options this week i took a look at the blu studio c super camera in order to see if it was the best smartphone you can buy that costs less than  bucksdesignthe blu studio c line of phones comes in a bunch of super crazy colors the one i have hear is a type of seafoam green color which has grown on me over time the unique thing about this phone is the camera the studio c super camera has an mp rear camera and a mp wide angle selfie camera after doing some research it appears that the sony imx sensor used in this blu studio c super camera was the same sensor used in the original nexus the blu studio c is also rocking a mediatek processor clocked at  ghz and a  armmali gpu overall performance on the blu studio c is pretty meh    but for a  dollar phone meh is actually pretty good performance will frustrate you every now and again but overall the phone works like its suppose toothe goodthe blu studio c has an  x   inch ips display which is shockingly good for the under  dollar price point the screen resolution is still super tight at p and you have to look super hard to see any pixels the screen also gets super bright and because it is an isp panel does a good job of remaining visible even when outdoors the studio c has the best screen on a phone for under a  dollars hands downanother awesome part about buying a blu phone is the accessories that are included with the phone so on top of the phone and the usual power cord and earbuds customers get a phone case and a protective cover huge props to blu for including those accessories especially because they can be harder to find for low cost low volume selling phonesalso  expandable storage thats all im going to saythe badthe worst part about the studio c super camera is the build quality of the phone i had this phone for just about two weeks when i started noticing an abnormal amount of wear and tear on the phone the corners and edges of the back case of the phone started to wear off from just rubbing against things in my pocket also the chrome painted trim between the back case and the screen has started to flake its only cosmetic damage but it has  it is disappointing that it happened so fastsomething i have mixed feeling about is the camera is it possible to get a good shot on the camera yes it actually really is but is it really hard to get a good shot on the camera yes it is really hard the camera lag on the phone is really really really slow which means its basically to take any photo of a moving subject or while you are moving for a  dollar phone to be capable of taking a good photo is pretty amazing but at the point where it is too hard to get a shot the improved camera specs just feel irrelevantconclusionif your budget is  dollars and you want a new smartphone you dont have a ton of options if you want a phone with a larger full hd screen as well then i can safely recommend the blu studio c super camera however if build quality and guaranteed updates are your thing then you are probably better off with the moto e nd gen,neutral

needed a replacement phone without paying the in store price the phone looked great and had a good price delivered in a decent amount of time and was in very good physical condition when inspected everything was great until  days later one of the keys fell off the keyboard apparently i am not the only one who has had this issue it concerns me that this is an ongoing problem with the people who supply these rebuilds and they have done nothing to address iti have asked about getting the phone fixed they required that i return the phone and then they will send a replacement or repair the existing phone which ever is the cheaper option for them also you have not phone and no way to directly transfer data between the old phone and the newly received one in my humble opinion this is bad business but as long as they keep selling phones they will keep up the same practices,neutral

granted this is an older model but i prefer to hold at least the semblance of a phone next to my ear than a wanna be ipad iphone  and others the format was easy to learn i also use mac computers i like the touch screen would prefer not to have the apple watch icon which so far i fail to find how to removei do not harbor hoards of pictures but do use the phone for my kindle books  and solfeggio music lots again and the gb seems to be adequate for my needs basically the phone is more for business than personal it is my first experience with texting and have to admit i have become a fan quick to the point get er done important in our no nonsense little time work worldimportant to know my account with att is a monthly no contract when i asked about a contract the sales rep told me because this is considered a third party phone i was not eligible for a monthly contract that requires buying your phone from an att distributor or directly from them for me this was fine i got a great deal with more data time than a contract arrangement and my monthly is less than another point to ponder no one really tells you that with this phone maybe others every month it is best to completely shut it down to reboot after all it is a computer i found this out when i lost capability to enter addresses into my contacts a friend who had used the is alerted me to the reboot feature doing this i have not had any further problems mechanicallycon that in a way all apple products are intrusive into our life by recording and keeping a digital record of everything you do on the phone calls texts web sites i understand android does the same but not as intrusive as apple i do not like this aspect at all be awareproduct was delivered per my special request on time product not exactly as described by seller and no instruction guide included because of some other customer service issues i find it difficult to recommend the third party seller,neutral
i like the phone it has  it is definitely lighter and more cheaply made than i expectedbut it has  it is a cheap phone so i should have known a little disappointed though because the plastic back is already chipped and broken and ive only had the cover off a couple of times to do the battery and the sim card,neutral
disappointed that it did not had a front facing camera,neutral
apparently has a short lifetime since everyone it gonna stop supporting g,neutral
not as cool as i thought only calls n texts must have a sd card to work right,neutral
this product was not new as the seller represented phone works well,neutral
its an ok phone for the price  runs very slow,neutral
the manuals are in chinese making it very difficult,neutral
the phone is definitely not new newly refurbished maybe there is a big scratch on the lower right hand of the case and it had the logo and name of a major wireless company,neutral
good looking phone with great battery life but a bit slow,neutral
this camera does not come with an sd card and the camera has no flash it has  it is ok so far but why they even bother making cameras without flashes is beyond me i have tmobile and i got this because i am not eligible for an upgrade for a while it worked as soon as i put my sim card in with no problems it seems to have problems doing a lot at once,neutral
i ordered black color and received white but still its ok,neutral
i ordered black color and received white but still its ok,neutral
it was not unlocked as described i had to email them to get the unlock code,neutral
the speaker is staticky cant really talk to someone text works,neutral
i got this phone last year and it has held up good its starting to turn off randomly what i hate the most is my apps closing i thought it was the app but it is does it with every app not sure why camera is ok getting and making calls is great i have had no issues i tried using tones but it would not stay connected not sure if it was the tones or the phone i wish it could upgrade to android ,neutral
good but slow the software is not genuine,neutral
not a very high quality phone but it works good for my young son to play games on,neutral
this was a temporary phone good reception,neutral
the seller was fast and the product was as described new in boxthis phone was ordered for some testing of features to resolve an issue we are having with yahoo and exchange activesyncthe problem we are having is the blackberry will not setup email accounts as expected we tested putting in a sim from tmobile and were not able to set up email at all after spending over  hours in the store with tmobile their answer was after calling rim it is a bad phone we the put in an att sim and got mail service to appear and setup but not the web based services only bes some of that may be because the prepaid services do not offer data for smartphonesas a whole i am completely underwhelmed by the blackberry bold  unlocked and its lack to work as it should,neutral
the phone was brand new as advertised but it was not factory unlocked i had to return it i guess i am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon,neutral
my son wanted a watch so i researched all over amazons choices this watch seemed to be excellent it came in i did not even open it just gave it to my son excited he has  he is  and a tech junkie he took one look at it and tossed it aside he has  he is about  feet tall and a big guy so it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him he said the watch face itself is much too huge too thick too big for him to wear he did not like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it altogether and was not interested in it any further he left on the table beside him and did not give it a second look even though i advised him all it could do nope not even remotely interested because it was too big i tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him ive still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago im keeping it though hoping that one day it will be useful to me im thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes but i really cannot speak up on it i have not used it no one wants to wear such a thick faced watch so the technical features have not yet been experienced so if i do take the time to find someone to use it i will be sure to update you on that the three stars is only that no one wants to wear it,neutral
beautiful phone its beauty is about as good as it gets i have had it for two full days and im at the point where im considering sending it back without wifi i cannot access internet even with wifi sometimes cannot access internet slow typing on keyboard battery is crap takes forever to change and battery drains even when im not using it or anything on it keeps saying it cannot find sim but its finding the tmobile network i have metro ive only seen it say metro once it shall  it will say g but have no connection wish i would have went with something else,neutral
i had purchased this as a gift for my fatherinlaw back in india my wife used it for few mots as our secondary phone the speakers are not that loud enough to notice a incoming callthe build quality is ok as expected from nokiaunfortunately this product did not work in india due to band difference and now it is used as a paper weight in india,neutral

first off me and my brother have the same phone both have been brokenit has  it is a very light weight phone with gb of ram which is important because android seems to use ram like crazy because it is very light it is very fragile i went from different generation of iphones and switched to this phone after i lost my iphone s  i thought im going to give android and other phones a trythis phone is great for people who do not often drop their phone or want great display and camera when i first got the phone i thought  is okay i recently got an iphone  and i realize how much i miss p even when i borrowed my brothers huawei honor x phone the p screen was so much better the colors on this is too saturated the camera is absolutely horrible try taking pictures without any decent lighting and it shall  it will be blurunlike many popular phones you cannot just go to the store or buy online the screen if you happen to crack it dropping it even once will crack your screen very badly there has  there is not many option for cases for this phone either i went to a chinese phone store and they wanted  for screen and install that has  that is almost the same cost as the phone itself after another drop inside my house the phone is dead the screen will not turn on same with my brother i had it for  months i cracked the screen within  weeksi am not saying this is a bad phone it has  it is just not for me i love taking photos and videos so the quality of the camera is very important i drop my i now a few times with a case and it has  it is still in perfect condition if you are careful with your phone and you are on a tight budget this phone is very good it does everything i need to do besides the camera i almost thought ill never go back to flagship phone but it has  it is like driving a ferrari and having to go back to a ford to each their own and hopefully this review will help some of you guys out there deciding,neutral
i thought the seller would send a new phonebut it was usedafter allit worked good,neutral
bought this phone for my girlfriend and it looks great and all great battery life and picture but one problem it will not let her send or receive texts sometimes and calls as well she has straight talk and it says she has signal but will not make calls or send textssometimes when we reboot it it will work but for a biti do recommend blu phones but i think we got a defective one,neutral
phone was not unlocked as it was said but other than that great phone,neutral
it is a great phone but i did not even drop it and somehow the screen broke while it was in my pocket at work do not see how that happens with an active phone,neutral
i like this cell the only complaint i have is that if you dont use it for about one hour it takes a while for it to come back up to operation mode meaning if i have to call  or any other number it kinda freezes for about  sec before i can get the dialing page or the contact page if it were faster it would be great and then id give it a  rating stars,neutral
hi bought this phone on june th and received it on june th i was excited about the phone when i received it but to my disappointment the box was already open and also did not include any headphones for the phoneoverall the phone looks great but after a month of use it seems there is some issues with it whenever i put my phone on hands free or turn on the speaker the person i am talking to cannot hear me and have to switch off the speaker,neutral
not easy to usto many steps for the set up,neutral
the case was more beat up than expected we had to remove the screen and unplug and replug the  screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently but other than that it has  it is an iphone and seems to work now the screen is failing more often and it is past the  day warranty we will likely need to replace it or the phone big bummer,neutral
ive had this watch for a few days now it synced to my android just fine downloaded the app for phone with the qr code fit is comfortable i have small wrists and it is not so huge it bothers me do not notice it really all notifications work well when i get a notification it plays my phone ringtone so both this and my phone are babbling minions till i check it the sleep monitor works fine only tried that once so idk how true but for last night being as i did not sleep it said poor seems right the pedometer works well but is a little slow takes a few to catch up texts messages come threw fine and you can reply to them phone calls come threw but i have not been able to talk on it due to interference with something else in my home possibly other bluetooth devices interfering browser remote capture image viewer and audio player i cannot get to function ive sent an email to the company due to this not really having instructions there was some but did not have much info so overall this is a good starter watch for someone wanting to try a smart watch which is why i bought it it works ok for the price will add more on email reply from company,neutral
cool for the money,neutral
the item arrived in good condition without knowing why i wish i clutch the flash will not work indicated in the product specifications,neutral
got phone in time condition is ok sides have minor and medium scratches the front panel was replaced something stuck under the front camera glass its visible and annoying since i see it all the time but camera works fineso far everything else works,neutral
this phone will arrive with an european travel charger you either need to carry an adapter with you all the time or spend another  to buy an oemoriginal samsung travel charger this is the first time i bought an electronic device from amazoncom with a noncompatible charger in north americai love the phone and i would give it  stars i had been iphone user since iphone g but i returned my iphone  and got a s edge i love the design the feel and the features,neutral
those phone seemed to be awesome a great screen nicely constructed it met or exceeded all expectations this is until i discovered it is not compatible with android auto due to the graphics processor in the phone it is not recognized by android auto if this feature is as important to you as it was to me then despite neoix having a great phone this is not the phone for you would out cost too much more to ensure you include a compatible graphics processor,neutral
this phone freeze alot i can be on different apps and it cuts off,neutral
i am a hard core nokia cellular phone buyer and user i stay with nokia because of their attention to detail and their quality products the only reason why i rated the c with  out of  stars is because of my own personal bias over all this was an excellent phone but because of my personal biases it just was not for me i do not like touch screen phones and i unfortunately had to try one out to know i do not like themthe good the small design for a full qwerty slide phone the ability to customize the home page of your phone allows you to have everything you need just a click away the applications that are free on the ovi store that can be used for the phone are nice and easily used such as games phone battery time remaining weather etc the ability to have a regular sized headphone jack is wonderful i could listen to my pink floyd on the bus or tune into a local radio station to pass the time in between classesthe bad transition time from upright to sideways mode can be a bit annoying this is especially for when you have applied a large theme to your phone but for me even having to waste one second on anything is annoying the lag time is about  second or less and for a large theme it can be up to  maybe  seconds the touch screen is not capacitive like iphone instead it is a touch screen that embraces some type of stylus ie fingernail or fine tipped plastic penthe ugly not being able to text with one hand my bias it is nearly impossible to text with one hand also the phone was designed for right handed people i am a lefty this is where my bias comes in almost all of the virtual decisionnavigationselection keys are on the right side along with volume rocker and navigation key on the qwerty board,neutral
phone could be better power button stopped working and it has rapid battery drain,neutral
i must say that its a great phone in great conditions on the outside however after few weeks of using the image on screen showed some lines until it black out completly that last only a momment not even an hour but doesnt happen all de time i wish the seller had been more honest about this,neutral
the phone is pretty good it covers the basics regarding mail internet and sms the only problems i have so far its that when i got it the screen have around  pixels that do not work also from time to time i have to turn it off an on again coz the app for communities is stuck and does not work but besides that the phone is a good deal for the price,neutral
nice phone but battery life is only    hrs on my new phone,neutral
very good this product,neutral

this phone was great i loved it so much until it quit charging on me,neutral
i waited quite some time before writing this review loved it at first until att updated my phone to the latest android version now i am thinking of replacing it as it add more and more quirks every day for example when i am looking for a specific contact in the contacts my phone opens up the att contacts list in the past i would just hit the back arrow to get out of that list and get into my google contacts list now it will not quit opening up the att contacts list even after i hit the back arrow it just keeps trying to load a nonexistent att list my mms on my text messaging also quit working after receiving the update i can no longer receive or send mms messages which can get very frustrating for those who are sending them to me i use straight talk for my cell service and of course no one in tech support there seems to know how to change the settings on this phone so that my mms will start working again the phone itself works fine  it has  it is just the pesky settings that need to get changed and since i am not nor will i ever return to att i am stuck wthese types of idiosyncrasies along wnew ones that keep popping up as att has somehow locked me from changing a few of the settings frustrating,neutral
i wanted the water tight one this is not it it protects from drops but dirt gets inside,neutral
the phone works great but they sent the wrong charging cord,neutral
i recently purchased this phone for my mom it works ok to do calls and stuff but there is not enough memory and you cannot downloadtoo many apps because it slows down the phone it has not enough memory i gave it  stars because the price was reasonableif you are going to use only for calls is fine but not to surf online and stuff,neutral
i have not used it much yet but it does seem somewhat difficult to navigate once you choose an option it has  it is hard to go back to the previous thing on the menu i usually have to start over i also wish it would unlock and answer by sliding the phone open it can be hard to find the answer call button in a hurry,neutral
work fine,neutral
it works well seems as the screen was replaced because the brightness are clarityquality is below the oem within  days of using it i had to factory reset once this phone is ok for me as a place holder the only thing that has not since ive received it is the dial tone when making selection during prompts i it does not recognize the tone ive reset the phone for this reason with the same results,neutral
in general it has  it is a fairly nice watch and works with the bt notification and the mediatek smartdevice app the latter allows for very intricate configuration of app and system service notifications android only four main negative issues while the device is truly m rom and will take firmware updates found in the xda developers forum this hardware does not work properly with those firmware screen appears upside down with other issues this device implies you can set custom wallpaper but when a new image is set it never actually gets applied ive tried x and x sized images in both gif and jpg formats i may have even tried png the bluetooth utility does not have a search feature like my dz this means that if you will have a problem trying to connect bluetooth headphones or headset that rely on the smart device to initiate the pairing so i have not been able to pair my headphones that i used to workout with the pedometer does not seem as accurate as my dz and none of the android apps ive tried on my samsung avant seem to work with calculating the data from the watch into meaningful results calories etc but this has been the case with the dz as well i tried a number of apps on my single avant and tried reboot combinations of all sorts but could not get the apps to receive data even though the phone did connect to the watches successfully,neutral
nice and cheap phone with under par processor hence execution performance is slow rest is great for the price,neutral
overall the phone is okay for the price range this is my th blu phone purchase in the past several years the battery does not last as long as my blu windows phone so i was a little disappointed google chrome does not work and i have updated it several times and still does not work the opera browser is an okay alternative but it is very slow every few days the phone will freeze up and will have to be rebooted,neutral
it has  it is ok,neutral
good product so farhave no problems with the device except that instead of a colour black that i ordered i got some ugly purpleish colour i was really peeved about that,neutral
overall it has  it is a good productbut i did see some minor blemishes such as scratches also the screen was popped out in one corner but the technology was fine,neutral
was not unlocked,neutral
i love this phone but it has a lot of flaws the flaws out weight the goodcons when charging it takes forever even when powered off took  hours to reach  on the factory charger when powered off tried new and old cables including different chargeing bases it gets very hot when charging to the point that a thermal warning appears it dies while charging when powered on when i use data the cell radio goes out even after the system updates there is no builtin music player i had to download a rd party music player from play store no builtin gallery other than google photosthis is a very nice phone but the flaws above makes it seem like this is a  or less piece of junkpros the screen is very nice i cannot see a single pixel the os seems almost stock the screen brightness is amazing,neutral
my watch do not have the camera on it sorry but i order the silver one with a camera on it please contact me back thank,neutral
i like the phone but it can be very slow at times and do some crazy things it is also a g phone so sometimes i cannot download pics from others who have more advanced phones but i do love having the dual sim and its been pretty durable because i have dropped it at least  times already,neutral
im really happy about this product the only thing i do not like is that sometimes i do not get the g most times it takes too much time to connect but apart from that everthing works perfectly it has  it is light and thin it has  it is beatutiful,neutral

so far i am loving this phone nice rich colors nice to see in sunlight i like all the features the buttons on the back do not bother me and that was the one thing i did not like when researching the phone i love the look and feel of the phone it has  it is a nice size not too small but not super huge takes great picturesvideo plenty of storage in my opinion so far i havent found anything i do not like my only issue is the usb cord does not want to stay plugged into the phone it has  it is very touch and if knocked will fall out i may be buying a new cord my son wants the same phone now so we will be ordering a second one i have had phone a few weeks now and i dontvlikecrhe fact thevphone gets really hot and its almostctoo hot to even use i alao had to orderca replacement charger as the one that came with ph would not stay connectedbbi am disappointed in how hotvthe ph gets not confident its going to last,neutral

i ordered a blackberry bold  from amazon and was very pleased to receive the product the very next day however on assembling the product i realized that the telephone had a very low ring volume even though i tried to select the loudest ring tone and set it at loud active i took it to a technician and it was revealed that the speaker on the phone was faulty and i would have to replace the speaker at a cost of  us dollars i was a bit upset as i reside out of the us and it would have been very inconvenient for me to return the telephone i was quite unaware of any where on the website where i could have made a formal complaint and then this invitation came asking me to make a review a bit of advise for amazon please check your products if possible before they are sold so that customers would be satisfied,neutral
good product,neutral
it is ok i was hoping for better performance i cannot have all the apps i want because it stops working,neutral
as a basic phone it is just okay it does not have strong cellphone reception and the bluetooth connection is continually dropping out to my car hands free system which makes for a less than stellar phone if you are outside a major metropolitan area the camera app is really nice with  panoramas but the speakers are very soft so not good for use in a noisy environment the battery may last you a couple of days if you are lucky and an infrequent user like myselfi bought this product for two main requirements though it had a dual sim capability and it was listed as one of the wifi calling capable phones by tmobile what tmobile do not tell you is that wifi calling is only enabled on phones purchased through them they will not update the software on this unlocked phone to enable wifi calling and samsung technical support can not update the software either i have yet to experience the dual sim capability with international roaming but im not holding my breath that that is going to work either so as a phone that will not tie you to a particular network it is again fairly useless unless you live in a major metropolitan area with good cellphone coverage,neutral
do not like battery goe dead a lot charge five x day not good iback to a windows phone nokia lumia,neutral
the charge port got damaged in less than half a year,neutral
overall it is a great phonesoftware and apps is as good as windows phones get but the battery life downright sucks it takes forever to charge and a a  min call would take away  battery lifeand this was not jus a defect on the particular phone because i exchanged it n the new one was the same,neutral
it was for a friend,neutral
this phone was a great disappointment i gave it  stars for the simple fact it has not dropped any calls yet and the screen is easy to read the back button has stopped working and none of the buttons at the bottom have ever lit up so you cannot see where they are at it dropps internet constantly to top it all off the charging cord is very loose and also constantly falls out,neutral

this would be one of the best phone ever if it works  with us carriers like verizon att or tmobile i called att they cannot recognize imei number but since phone is unlocked still i can use it only thing i have to compromise with speed this one has network type g hspa not lte default language is chinese i change language to english but still inbuilt news default language is chinese and top of that i have to buy warranty separately from samsung,neutral
this phone has good features but it restarts automatically quite often i tried to factory reset and update the software still notice that this problem still exists,neutral
an excellent phone just be aware that it does not work on g lte like its usa counterpart just on g if you usr a lot of wifi like me you will enjoy the power and speed of this phone at a price  lower,neutral
the only thing keeping me from giving this phone  stars is the fact that the volume on the alerts and ringtone are so low that i cannot hear them i have missed every phone call received because i simply cannot hear the phone ring i even downloaded sound boosters which have done little to alleviate the problem i would love to hear from someone that could tell me how to fix this issue,neutral
somehow expensive,neutral

update there was a recent ota update that improved the performance and addressed some of the issues i had with the phone the battery life seems better i can get through the day without fearing i am going to run out of juice phone seems a little snappier have not really noticed keyboard slow down latelycool feature to schedule shutdown and start of the phone had been addedstill have issue where music controls take few seconds to react i am using google music also if you take headphones off music keeps playing for few seconds and the bluetooth issue where it switches back to the phone still existsoverall though i am happier with the phone after the update i was pleasantly surprised and i will bump up the rating to  stars if there are more updates that improve the phone i will adjust rating accordinglyto address blu commentsi am using nova launcher and it alleviates some of the issues but accessing phone settings is really difficult still cannot find trusted devices option no launcher can change layouts of settings menuoriginal reviewi got this phone right when it came out it is my primary phone since then my previous phone was one plus one which i loved this phone i have really mixed feelings about the positive things  the screen is great storage is plenty micro sd slot good to have cpu is good enough for what i use it for finger sensor is pretty much flawless camera is passable when it works negatives  the ui is dismal at best even after i installed nova launcher a lot of settings are hidden and hard to find and some you cannot find at all trusted devices option for example the settings menu is on the bottom and is completely non stock android if this was only problem i could live with that ui is sluggish when i listen to music and i press stop music keeps playing for another  seconds bluetooth has been poor for me when i use headset and i call someone sometimes it switches from bt headset to phone for no reason and i have to switch it back manually even typing is super slow sometimes i have to wait  or  seconds after key press for something to appear camera is slow to start and if you have gestures enabled you will be taking pictures of your pocket a lot battery life is terrible sometimes completely drained after  or  hours i know this is not the fault of the phone but xda community is really small they got root but there are no alternative roms on the horizon the only thing that could save this phoneif this phone was closer to stock android and basic things just worked it would be my favorite phone for  you get great hardware but everything else is bad i had many phones nokian nhtc mytouch g lg l nexus  nexus moto x first and second gen one plus one nexus  i have never disliked a phone as much as i disliked this one probably because it promised so much but it totally failed to deliver if your main draw is the screen and media consumption this would be a good fit at everything else this phone falters,neutral

i am not happy that i was not given a charger for this phone when it said that it would this phone does not use a typical charger so i had to go and spend more money for a charger to fit the phone if you are going to say that something is going to come with a purchase then put it in the packaging it can also be said that if you are not going to have everything then say so as well,neutral
two weeks and the proximity sensor stoped working,neutral
the phone works and all  it came in a sealed original box only problem is my sim card could not fit inside the sim slot  the sides of the sim slot was too small and i ended up with a phone but no sim card and therefore no service  i suggest people buy a samsung galaxy phone from an original phone carrier,neutral
ive had this watch for a few days now it synced to my android just fine downloaded the app for phone with the qr code fit is comfortable i have small wrists and it is not so huge it bothers me do not notice it really all notifications work well when i get a notification it plays my phone ringtone so both this and my phone are babbling minions till i check it the sleep monitor works fine only tried that once so idk how true but for last night being as i did not sleep it said poor seems right the pedometer works well but is a little slow takes a few to catch up texts messages come threw fine and you can reply to them phone calls come threw but i have not been able to talk on it due to interference with something else in my home possibly other bluetooth devices interfering browser remote capture image viewer and audio player i cannot get to function ive sent an email to the company due to this not really having instructions there was some but did not have much info so overall this is a good starter watch for someone wanting to try a smart watch which is why i bought it it works ok for the price will add more on email reply from company,neutral

i just recieved this phonei understand when a product is used very good that i should account for somephysical signs of use this phone has a corner ding which is typical of dropping the phoneohter than that just normal scratches from usewhat i am most unhappy about is that there is a dimmed portion of the screen right above thecenter button i will post a photo sooni have purchased used electronics in the past i would have liked the description to have stated that thescreen itself would have some damage not cool this should have been included in teh description asi would have seeked an alternative as i could care less about the body its all about the screen especially with thisbeing my first iphone,neutral

outstanding functions takes fantastic pictures with great macro and highspeed capturebut the keyboard yikes no sensory feedback at all it has  it is actually tiring to use the keyboard i had this phone for two weeks the first week i toyed with it until i got an inexpensive case to protect it the second week it was my fulltime carry phonei just could not live with the keyboard which is a crying shame considering the functionality of the device im not a huge guy but i just could not keep from hitting the wrong keys and it was painful after a while even tryingpros outstanding photos macro highspeed modes work great fast focus multiple shot modes typical great nokia reception holds g really well big crisp screen snappy oscons unusable keyboard naviwheel is nifty gadget but is only implemented in a handful of places in the os and not at all in rd party apps too sensitive,neutral

this phone have great features and lovely camera but i have had this phone for a few months now and placed it to charge and now is refusing to come back on this happened with a previous one i had and just thought that one was defective i just rang the phone and although the phone calling it is saying it is on the phone itself is not respondingwaiting for the battery to die again to see if it really has an issue ,neutral
good phone for the money however all the instructions came in german  i do not speak german  i am still guessing some of the features and at times it is frustrating also sometimes the volume goes lower by itself,neutral
the volume button did not work  of the time i bought it assuming it was new it was not the screen was not the original the battery was old and inflated when i tried to charge the phone i had to hold the charger in for a few seconds to make sure it was charging even then it would stop charging on it has  it is owni had to buy a brand new phone full priced to make sure i was not getting another new phone,neutral
this rating is about a  there were some files on the phone that was not made clear at time of purchase like the worn backside and the rubber insert on the charging area besides that it works great pictures are worth a thousand words be picky,neutral
the set gets warm so fast battery does not hold the power long enough,neutral
this phone would be perfect if it was not for the battery life with moderatehigh use im lucky if it lasts  hours,neutral
this is a nice phone but unlocked phones do not operate adequately if they are not from your carriers line of phones this was an att i believe phone but my network is tmobilethis phones gps almost never gave me a realtime update which is a huge problem for me it had other little glitchy network error issues had to return,neutral

this blackberry  was purchased used the loudness or volume of the phone was adjusted to maximum by me according to the instructions that were readily available for download on the internet i deliberately shopped for an unlocked phone so that i could use it on a vacation trip in europe after loading it with a sim chip that was compatible for the country in which i was traveling i discovered that the cell phone was barely audible i spent a lot of time running to quiet spots and holding one hand over the opposite ear from the ear that was pressed to the phone even then i missed a lot of words i had to resort to sending text messages as often as i could which this blackberry was excellent at doing upon return to the usa the vendor could not figure out how to correct this problem with hearing the phone,neutral
i had bought  blu life one and  blu vivo air i gave the vivo to my mom and the life ones to my dad and little brother because they absolutely loved themso i had to get myself a new phone and i decided to get another blu since the excellent experience i had with those other phones well i chose this blue life xl because i thought it was the  edition which is not the delivery was very fast as always when i took it out of the box i was lightly disappointed because the screen had some lines like pixels with rainbow colors and if you watch the phone from different angles they are more notorious and the back cap seems to be made of hard paper it was a pain in the ass to opened because i did not wanna break it  next i put the battery in and charged until it was turned it on and started to set my google account and information everything set up so let us startthe screen wallpaper was blurrybut was oki downloaded all my apps and did not run out of spaceput my gb sd card in to try the sound and the video reproducer the sound is not great but is good and is better if you use headphones not the ones that come in the box i liked the big screen because you can watch videos and movies and the poor definition of the screen is not a problem therenext thing i tried was the camera which i do not use so muchthe rear camera is ok take nice and clear pics but the front camera sucks i took a few selfies and my face looked blurrythe battery life is great for how much i use my phone check facebook instagram snapchat etcsend a couple texts and make a couple calls of  mins and i got  of battery by the end of the day so i do not have to worry to leave the phone charging overnight i can charge it in the morning in  mins well now i put the sim card in  i hate that i had to turn off the phone and take out the battery  and it automatically recognised tmobilebut surprise it did not support g only g but that was not a problem for how much data i usewell overall the things i did not like about the phone we arethe screen is freaking hard to use you have to push the screen several yes in order to open an app or when typing the definition is very poori could not turn turn the brightness down it always went back to highdid not save some default changes like the auto corrector keeps turning onthe camera sucksi was going to return it but my sister came over this summer to celebrate his sons bday so i thought this would be a great present for a  years old and yes it was he totally loved it he plays games all day and watch movies in it so this phone was a great deal after all but isnt good for a teenager or adult that use it for texting or social medial but for  is a good deal,neutral

i instantly fell in love with this item and it worked great it was wonderful that it was unlocked because i could get straight talk with it no contract or anything just  a month but after a couple of months it started to act up turns off by itself deleted messages just pop back up closing out of apps on its own  there really is not enough space on this phone so pretty much i do not like the item anymore and will be needing a new phone,neutral

i have had this phone for about  days and i have been able to customize it more than any other phone that i have ever had the camera is everything that it was cracked out to be and as far as i can tell the pictures turn out perfectly every time the size is great and the battery is not as bad as i had read before buying the device being that we can use it for about  hours of heavy use on a full battery but if we are moderate it will last a good  hours or more the user interface is not the best but for a  phone i cannot complainbut after about a month of use i started having an issue where suddenly the phone will just comipletely shut off for no apparent reason it also has been lagging a bunch too lately i have not had similar problems but my wife claims that the battery gets very hot when we charge it and i believe my problem is that when i run the phone too heavy it gets hot and shuts off it is only a month old and i will send it in to get fixed but not a good sign for a phone ive only had for about  days,neutral
nice phone worked right out of package but the battery life does not last very long  hrs that is it  screen freezes up randomly,neutral
does what it need to do,neutral
while yes the phone is unlocked however you are unable to activate for cricketdo not be like me and not do simply research,neutral
do not be played by the phone it is not a bad phone by any means but for this price it is garbage compared to it has  it is new competitors the specs are out of date and the phone just is not what it used to be software and hardware dates and that has  that is what happened to this phone if you want a phone for your moneys worth go look at moto g phones or even xiaomi and if you feel like putting in a little more effort check out the company oneplus with their phone the oneplus x for  you will not be disappointedbase point look somewhere else for a phone as a man who loves phones do not go towards this pick good phone not for the price too much better competition,neutral
ok product charger n phone heat up not safe,neutral
very happy with purchase came on time and was brand new within a couple of weeks i noticed a crack in the bottom right hand corner of the screen this was annoying seeing as my last phone made it over a year without so much as a scratch on the screen unfortunately purchasing this way as far as i could tell left me without a warranty i was aware of this before purchasing the item but i also expected the item to last longer than a couple of weeks before cracking my experiences purchasing phones from amazon this holiday season has given me second thoughts of ever doing it again,neutral

came in a generic box instructions are ridiculously vague and incomplete can not use camera unless you have a sim card interface is plain and difficult to grasp when recording audio and video the screen stays on for about  seconds then goes dim but does not completely turn off otherwise this is a good watch if you can figure out the software interface,neutral
the only thing that was wrong with this phone it does not have a built in flash so you have to have good background light or the pictures will come out dark,neutral

this is a nice inexpensive smartish watch i have an iphone s plus and after some trial and error i finally got it paired with my phone the display is nice and it has multiple analog faces to choose from because it is round you cannot read all of the information that appears at the top of the screen the pedometer did not match my phones pedometer which i kept in my pocket all day the sound quality is good but not loud unless it is ringing and you cannot turn that down also all of my apps now play sound solely through the watch which i do not like i did like how i got text notifications even if i could not reply to them my problem with siri is it only wants to call my phone so over all not bad for the price i guess but i am sending it back for those glitches mentioned above,neutral

the phone itself was great however i did not realize until the past couple of weeks that there are many features that are lacking because it is an international phone most of these features are minimal and do not really effect the phone however there are some issues the first is that you can not get hd voiceadvanced callingnumber sync with this phone so you will not be able to use a gear s with it except through a bluetooth connection which would not let you use the watch on its own as a phone without your actual phone being within rangeit is also near impossible to get support from samsung regarding this phone because of it being international they will not support itthe only other issue seemed to be that the battery life was not as good as it should have been it barely made it through a whole day without needing a charge but i dont have anything to compare that to,neutral

got this phone for my  yr old dad who is visually impaired not as spry as he used to be and lives with me and my wife he only has the phone so one of us can contact him if we are going to be late getting home or just to check on him if we are out and abouthe does not make outgoing calls although ive made a few during the set up phase and found it to be like any other cell phone  you enter the number and press the green key voilathe phone is an unlocked dual band gsm phone i bought an att sim card and set this phone up under the att gophone plan it is a pay as you go plan which cost around  for  minutes that last for  days i refill the amount every quarter and the remaining minutes roll over the clarity on the att system is fine for the limited number of times i call himbecause my dad is legally blind and very slow in his movements other nonflip phones i bought for him just and snapfonwere hard for him to unlock press the green key to answer the call press the red key to end the call and finally relock the keypad i thought this phone would allow him to answer incoming calls by simply opening it up however this phone requires you to flip it open and then press the green key to answer the call it does however disconnect the call when the flip phone is closed do not have to press the red key i doubt this would be an issue at all if there are no serious visual issues involved the keys are back lite and very large i require glasses to see anything up close but i can clearly see the numbers on this phone without my specsthis phone would be perfect for my dads needs if receipt of text messages could be turn off and the phone could be answered when it is flipped open without pressing the green key however compared to other senior phones this phone is okay and meets my dads needs,neutral

received the phone in april and thought it was the the best affordable  phone on the market i was comparing the style the vivid screen and picture quality to an iphone little did i know that the phone would began to crap out on me ive had the phone for five months now and it suddenly started randomly powering off by itself and taking a least a minute or two to repower the phone went from that issue to now suddenly the camera will not work ive tried all the troubleshooting i know of and even contacted the blu brand they inform me that it has  it is technically nothing they can fix just return the phone back to the manufacture and they will try to fix it meanwhile i would be left with no phone in process not even a loaner phone fyi probably will never buy blu brand again even though their phones are beautiful stylish and vivid color screens the internal quality is not up to par buyer beware,neutral

the phones were looking as brand new and working perfectly i bought  phones at the time both of them were unsealed they are working perfectly and look like brand new but inside the box were the headphones that was worth probably  sound was awful the buttons were not working hardly could plug it in to the phone so the seller probably switched it and kept the good ones for himself when we recieved  iphones i went to tmobile and it was not working they matched the phone in their system and it was reported as a stolen phone but next day the seller changed it to a new one,neutral
it was cool for a sec,neutral
i purchase this phone for a friend in the end she like it and wish it came with a manual,neutral
it has  it is not a perfect fit there is a little play in it,neutral
battery gets warm frequently and sometimes hot otherwise it would be a great one,neutral
it glitches really bad when on the charger and it just recently started glitching even when not on the charger,neutral
update after five months with this phone i downgraded it from  stars to  it has  it is still a pretty good value for a  smartphone but over time i grew to hate this phone the lag using apps and browsing became pretty frustrating to the point where i could not wait to get a flagship or midranger additionally the camera is pretty much unusable taking photos with either googles camera app or the default blue camera app any motion destroys the shot even without motion images are fuzzy noisy and distorted overall though i cannot fault such an inexpensive phone too much though you get what you pay fori purchased this as a holdover until i find a new phone i like i want phone with flagship speed and camera quality but with a  inch screen and a huge battery at this point no such thing existsalthough im optimistic about the next nexus  previously id been using my  nexus  which is still the best phone ive ever owned my only issue with the nexus  had been the battery and ive used and abused it so much the battery drains very quickly nowso i came across the blu studio here for the price this thing is pretty impressive the screen looks nice  to my unsophisticated eye it has  it is reasonably close in quality to any other smartphone it will not knock your socks off but it has  it is definitely not as bad as some cheap phones the blue studio is pretty much stock android which is a must for me the battery life has been excellent over the last couple of months which is one of the key reasons i went with this as a stopgapas for the negatives the blu studio is pretty sluggish at times also the version i got does not have lte the speed is serviceable though and it does have the slower g on att which is not terrible both of these things i can overlook on a  phone the one aspect i am having difficulty with though is the camera it has  it is terrible ive tried different apps as well the default and googles but the photos it takes are practically useless i find myself taking my work phone samsung s to any occasion i may need to snap a picture even so it has  it is a  phone  it has  it is difficult to expect much more the camera is just the one aspect i have not been able to adjust my expectations down toso overall  if you are looking for a serviceable unlocked phone for cheap and do not mind sacrificing some multitasking abilityspeed and camera quality then this is a great buy,neutral
so far so good but here is why im giving it a three star first of all the keyboard jumps a lot u wanna write one thing and it ends up writing something else for u secondly it hangs apps apps take forever to open and when they dotakes another round of forever to load up apart from that phone is ok i hope it lasts ps took me mins just to write this that has  that is how bad d keypad is,neutral

you get what you pay forprosthis is a cheap unlocked phone the battery life is nice it often would last me a couple of days with minimal use the display and camera are decent for the price the phone overall looks nice in my opinion i have dropped the phone a few times on asphalt and besides a scratch or small dent it still worked fine the os for the most part is niceconsthe phone lags at times and can be slow the processor is lower end which is one of the reasons the battery lasts so long since the processor is not that good it tweaks out sometimes when using more resource heavy apps like google maps i would have to make sure no unneeded apps were open to prevent the phone from being too slow my device got port damage after four months and i was not being abusive to the phone at all i was not bending the cable at the port while the phone was plugged in i do not think this phone was made to last,neutral
it has a best display ever cool fast system and the camera works perfect except the phone i receive have a big pink circle in video recording such annoyance when you are taking a video with indoor light and it does not have a last long battery i have to charge it twice a day,neutral
this phone was okay when i got it the only reason i bought it because my husban had a phone like but for some reason mines didnt work as perfect as his i was his in the washing machines and it still work but one day i drop mines and didnt work again so best to say dont by a used phone because you dont know what it went throughand the owners words,neutral
needed a quick phone i do believe i returned this one as it did not work with my carrier and was not unlocked anyway,neutral
 i got the phone for my son say he is having difficulty with the applications could not delete still learning the phone,neutral
the case was more beat up than expected we had to remove the screen and unplug and replug the  screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently but other than that it has  it is an iphone and seems to work now the screen is failing more often and it is past the  day warranty we will likely need to replace it or the phone big bummer,neutral
i got the blu studio  lte because it is american made and has amazing features for a great price ill start with the pros then list the cons cameras both back and front take awesome pictures and videos video streaminggraphics amazing screen size is huge but after a day of use i fell in love with the size apps run smooth and clear game graphics are beautiful this phone is not overly heavy but does feel well made not cheaply made like some of the more expensive phones on the marketthe powervolume buttons are very sensitivenow on to the cons for this phone the phone freezes or lags extremely bad when trying to view pictures in the photo gallery the screen goes black at random moments during use and will not come back onthis may be a problem with my unit only the overall volume for the phone is really low even after doing the update i have a  yr old daughter and if she has  she is in the room playing or we are watching the tv at volume lvl  i have to walk out to be able to hear the power and volume buttons are on the same side and too close together the way most of us hold our phones this button config will take a bit of getting use to and if you have smaller hands like me you just have to deal with it larger hands have issues too as their hands wrap more completely around this phone and can hit the buttons more often than notfor a case you only have the case that comes with the phone a the flimsy rubber case that covers only the back you can buy a knock off case which does not fit and some wallet style cases which fit any current smartphone that sell for around  plus shipping for women this is great but only if you like the wallet styles which i do not guys you are just out of luck on cases if you prefer a hard case like a otterbox or lifeproof this leaves you out as well they just do not make them for this brand at alli would love to see blu step up to the main stream market with these phones but they have a few issues to fix first if they can and do i will be st in line to purchase another blu product,neutral
it does not work on tmobile for wifi calling had to return it,neutral
this was for my son to replace a phone he damaged at work he is a college student but is a foreman for his scene shop so he has  he is always on call he needed a qwerty keyboard because he sendsreceives so many texts about things at the theatre that it has  it is easier but due to his job he has  he is always banging himself and phone on wood pieces metal grating ladders etc so a full screen front was out of the questionthat has  that is how he damaged the other one plus cost was a major factor knowing he shall  he will damage it again probably he liked the fact that on the school wireless he could always check email with this phone too again important to his job this phone is not g it is not a smart phone it is not able to access internetemail from anywhere just places where wifi is available like a college campusall that said it fit the bill for him very well he likes it thus far though he has  he is only had it at school less than  weeks he says it seems fine for what he needed it for the reason for  stars is just that for most folks this will not do as much as they wanthowever if you are looking for a smartphone alternative for a college student who is nearly always on the school interface this works as a very nice inexpensive alternative,neutral
did not work but refunded without an issue,neutral
this phone is not that bad for the price it takes time to learn how to use it and worst thing in this phone is way outdated symbian operation system another things are not bad,neutral
its a great phone for calling texting pictures and use a few apps now the screen size is a plus very clear but some times get unresponsive the speakers for talking are great but to listen music not that great and the reason i give a  stars is the battery very poor performance the meter tells you you have one day of power and in reality last around  hours for me its a great phone but the battery bad performance over lap the other great features of the phone if you are into internet videos games and music i wont recommend it for the lack of power in battery if only use for calling texting taking pictures in other words just the basic then its ok for you,neutral
the phone came in the expected time with all its complete accessories but even if only a short time of use have been problems with the battery and sometimes is very slow and gets stuck,neutral
i like this however it did not work out i returned it the battery life will exceed your expectations and when it is idol it barely losses any battery percentage i had the sim port stop working and the power button within a week i lost a call in the place i never drop calls,neutral
despite the guaranteed delivery time the phone came a few days late however it works and came as described,neutral
everything is good  but  major problem is sound is very low we cannot hear this very problem for everyone ,neutral
i bought this phone to play ingress because i was told the gps was really impressive it is not and worse the phone is not really powerful enough to play ingress it serves its purpose as a locked down phone for ops in low data areas but that has  that is it,neutral

good iphone but not what im looking for,neutral
overall it is a good phone but the camera quality is very poor,neutral
finally everything was right,neutral
the touchscreen system is really bad when writing text other letters rather than the wanted one are pressed which makes it very uncomfortable besides the textcorrector software sucks the camera is pretty lowresolution which is ok by me because i rarely use itthe reason i bought this phone is that it has  it is the cheapest g lte phone with gb expandible memory but i should have probably payed  more bucks for a better blu model and get a phone which does not go crazy when writing text,neutral
this would have been an okay phone is i could actually set it up with straight talk the camera is also a little blirry,neutral
for my taste it is a good article i worked as i expected and i could only use for three weeks because the applications install him becomes too slow and did not work well,neutral
this a straight talk locked phone it advertises being unlocked but when you buy the sim card starter kit it wil not recognize it because it is a straight talk phone if you are buying it because its unlocked do not,neutral
basic phone the camera quality is not good not very much storage space as expected,neutral
very good product,neutral
owned four of them for about two years before decided to upgrade icons on buttons started to fade away after the first year this phone has a slight delay in moving between different components if one is looking for an older styled phone that can handle being dropped a couple times then this is a good option,neutral
as a novice user of this type of equipment i give it only a  star rating i have not experienced this type of phone and have been dramitacally challenged to learn how to use it it would be great if there were a beginners manual to teach all this phone has to offer at times i became so frustrated i simply had to put it down and walk away while i can use it for communication purposes i still know very little if anyone could direct me to a better way of learning instead of trial and error  i would much appreciate it,neutral
i thought it was a pretty cool phone until i found out that i could not surf the web even with data service due to the phone being so old thus it has  it is no longer supported by tmobile or so i was told by a tmobile rep you can make calls and text though so if that has  that is all you wantneed then sure it has  it is alright the game preinstalled on it is uhh no thanks however i did like the little light show on the home button so pretty,neutral
after quite some time that ive had this watch all i can say is that you get what you pay for so not too bad  of course there are much better smart watches but if you are considering this one it has  it is because you are on a certain budget limit syncs fine and battery life is not bad  touch is not going to be the most fluid but it has  it is not the worst eithernot too bulky and looks professional,neutral
great camera screen is somewhat fragile first smartphone ive ever broken the screen on and within the first month ,neutral
the phone lte data was supossed to work on bands   and  it did not work over claro  nor over movistar  g network did work correctly i already know xperia z which is an excelent device the problem in here is not over the product in the label of the box where the imei number is i can read g glte ar en fafr which looks to me the countries it was designed for this information does not match the description of the product in here also after printing the order summary i found that the covered bands differ from which you can read in the product description page i am returning the phone,neutral

good news i do love the concept of talking into my dick tracy wristwatch being able to tell time write emailstext messages and listen to my mp files all with handsfree operation having the convenience of a smart phone on my wrist without having to carry or unholster a cell phone is excellent especially when walking my dog or listening to music on the treadmill it has  it is a fascinating watch that is a great showpiece in public venuesive sent the amazon link to many inquiring minds that want a wristwatch callers can hear me pretty well though i sometimes strain to hear their responses in public venuesnot so good news the phone will not connect to my bluetooth earpiece which would improve my ability to hear folks on the phone without holding my wrist to my ear occasionally i get feedback reverb in the background i also have issues connecting to the internet uses wap less than a month after purchase my earbud is not connecting properly so i can no longer utilize the fm radio ear piece must be connected and replacement parts are not  am not available on amazon for the price it has  it is a great start for wristwatch cell phones but i would work on the compatibility issues to make it more functional in the us for the internet and bluetooth,neutral
a very sturdy phone little bit slushy at times but makes my teenaged son happyhappy heats up soon with few appsgames running and especially if you have a protective case as an ardent sony fan the price and the quality of this phone is good would have given  if not for the sluggish and heat factor best suitable for an early teen with minimal usage and as expected gaming usage,neutral
i have had this product before it stopped working two months after i purchased it i would never ever buy another motorola product again due to their horrible customer service and malfunctioning products,neutral
there is little contrast between the letters and the background when writing messages  should improve this aspect of the phone in addition it is impossible to graduate the volume during the call although this is a useful phone if you want something simple  calls and messages and at low cost,neutral

not a bad product but i prefer my unlocked galaxy s the upgrades do not over shadow the s in anyway also its a droids version of an i phone no external memory you cannot add a chip iot save songs or more pictures you only have the cloud for memory if you are in a location that limits connectivity you do not have access to your stored music files pictures i like being able to add gigs of memory to my s the s also has a sealed battery compartment like the i phone so you cannot change the battery or carry extra batteries for long camping trips you also have to keep a special pin on hand to eject or change you sim card that has  that is very inconvenient during international travel and your changing sims you get a better bang for your buck when you buy the s hopefully the s will bring back external memory so i have both the s and s but will not be changing to the s i may sell it of give it to my kid who does not need the memory or dual sims for travel,neutral
i was expecting something way cooler it did work but kinda cheesy when you compare it to the samsung newest watch i sent this back,neutral

ive already owned a razr v for  months and this is pretty much exactly the same as the one i got from my mobile provider except for a few things  the software on it is slightly different and has some att specific things installed and an att logo on the back  the color is different old one gray this one black  my old one felt like metal whereas this one feels like plastic maybe my old one just wore down the coating and this one is not worn down yet and so the coating feels different but it feels cheaper to me than my old one i guess time will telli had to buy a new phone when my old ones display went out and i did not want to get locked into a  year contract so got this one unlocked is nice i thought about getting something fancier but this phone works pretty well as a basic cell phone and i do not really want to be paying  extra a month for wireless internet right nowall the good things about this phone involve its small size and the fact that it has  it is a flip phone it fits in the pocket nicely the flip phone means your pocket does not call people since the buttons are closed up inside of it when it has  it is flipped closed my last one lasted  months being rubbed against other stuff in my pocket and the coating got chipped and beat up but the phone kept working in fact it has  it is still working but the display went out one day when i was charging it and never came back so i needed a new phone so im not dialing blind and unable to read text messagesthe bad points are that the software is not particularly great and it has  it is hard to find things and make it do what you want the address book is really limited and you have to enter multiple entries for the same person if you want to put multiple numbers in for them i cannot really imagine browsing the internet or watching videos on this thing though i guess maybe someone does it the camera is ok but not particularly spectacularit has  it is really all about the compact size flipphone design solid feel and functionality as a phone or phone and textmessage only device,neutral

this phone sounded like a dream come true gb of ram gb of internal memory with expandable memory long battery life fingerprint reader and best of all affordablei was very excited to have this phone i even preordered it so essentially ive had the phone since it has releasednow remember those features we have all been wanting in an affordable smart phone let us talk about them  months into owning this phoneprocessing speedthis phone is not the speediest although i knew this when i purchased the phone i was expecting to have lag and stutter on the phone every now and then especially for demanding applications i found this phone struggling way too often with apps like snapchat and chrome i came from a nexus  and the performance that i was getting was about the same in some cases worst although when it comes to things like messages phone calls and less demanding apps like twitter it ran without hiccups again it has  it is important to take the phone price into consideration but im pointing out performance because that gb of ram is not helping too muchfingerprint readerthe fingerprint reader works okay when i made a profile for my thumb to be able to unlock the phone the process was painless although when it came to unlocking my phone it frequently did not registered my thumb i would try different positions but no luck what i did to remedy this was make different profiles of the same thumb this way it allowed for more ways for my thumb to be positioned it worked but then another problem came up the fingerprint reader is positioned in a spot where it gets a lot of finger time so it tends to get a bit smudgy and i often have to wipe the fingerprint reader for it to read my finger ive asked others about their fingerprint scanners on their phones such as iphones and lg phones and that issue is not as common although those are  devicescamerathe camera is okay i could not imagine what the non plus model camera is like it takes awesome pictures if the lighting is great and the objects are not  am not moving it does take pictures very slowly especially with hdr on one thing that is inconvenient about the phone is that it zooms in a little when recording video another is that when it comes to snapchat video it performs awfully the video playback runs extremely choppybattery lifethe battery life is really really great with lighttomoderate use it gets a full ampm charge the battery takes about  hours to charge from  to deal breaking issuethe phone recently started to have some major issues it shuts off randomly when the battery is below about  let us say im at a concert and i want to take a picture if the phone is at  as soon as i open either snapchat or the camera app it just shuts off when the percentage is lower the problem gets worse at about  ive had the phone shut off when i open my regular apps such as twitter or google maps this has been a huge headache and has ruined the phone experience for meive submitted for a replacement and hopefully these issues do not exist anymore but until then my review will stay like this,neutral

it was exactly as advertised not what i wanted tho decided to have lg repaired which is what i should have done first,neutral
the phone was mostly good pretty slippery and heavy but felt good in my hands camera was average lots of android phones on the market have better camera experiences my nexus  camera is as good if not better anyway i returned the phone within  hours because it would get so hot after  minutes of continued use i would have to put it down not even in my pocketyes many phones out there can get hot but not this fast my nexus  does not even get that hot after  minutes i really wanted this to be a good phone but i am disappointed overall not a bad attempt from zte ill be waiting for the new moto x pure or nexus ,neutral
could have being better,neutral
i personally love this phone immensely but when i received it the upper speaker was partially blown it still plays music out loud but if i turn it up too high it rattles the boom speakers are half the reason i chose this phone so that has  that is quite the bummer also after having this phone for a couple months the screen itself is starting to pull up with the glass screen protector i can see inside the phone im not sure if that can be reglued down but i guess ill have to just figure it out,neutral
it is bit complicate,neutral
phone works well however the screen is now popping off the front i was disappointed to notice this hopefully just a little gluell fix it up real nice,neutral
the size of the phone is great the bad part is that sometimes the phone freezes and the screen will revert back to the home screen without a button being pressedsome of the apps do not work like youtube it would not download for me it would be nice if the phone supported g lte i am undecided on whether i want to keep this phone or upgrade to a cheap g supported phone,neutral
i purchased it to be unlock when i arrived in the bahamas to use phone i was unable to because the phone was locked,neutral
phone had problems it would not power back on if u let it die all the way,neutral

i recently purchase this blackbery phone but for some unknown reason it is not allowing ne to send sms texts i previously bought the same phone but i do not have this problem i am not sure if it has to do with some special setting or not,neutral
it keeps dropping the signal every five minutes i have to rest it often i just cracked the screen where can i send it to have it repaired ,neutral
given this a  star because i have not decided if im gonna keep it or send it backconsif you think you can get it off gsm time you cannot if it is actually am it shows to be pm i do not like the military time for the alarm also if you set it for pm you need to set the alarm for am  pm would need to be set for  am the battery does not stay charged i have to put it on the charger about every  to  hoursit has  it is not very comfortable to wear i cannot send or receive text or use any of the other web functionspros i can receive and make calls without a sim carduse btpretty easy to set up with blue tooth came on time,neutral
phone works great but im still wondering how come there has  there is an outgoing call on my supposedly new device dated april th  even though i bought it on july   also when the phone starts it appears the movistar logo on full screen so im thinking was not it supposed to be factory unlocked i do not know what that is anymore then,neutral
for the most part i like this phone i was not going to use the internet capabilities but i think i pushed the wrong button and got signed up the touch screen is a little quirky when i try to scroll it takes me to whatever area im touching to move the screen as with most other phones of this type the screen disappears in daylight and i have to find a dark shadow to read the screen id rate this phone b to b for the money it does a good job,neutral
not even two days of battery life,neutral
this phone is very nice especially for the money cannot understand why the internet icon disappeared after the upgrade and never returned after doing a complete reboot as directed by blu manufacturer i guess it has  it is a glitch in the phone nevertheless i had to download a internet icon from play store to be able to access the internet overall for the money the phone is very nice,neutral
phone works great one major drawback is you do not hear clearly unless you use the earpieces,neutral
i like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that i can say other than that it is a good phone,neutral
worked for  days then today it comes on then shuts back off it gets really hot while charging to,neutral
simple works a phone has good volume and very long battery life i broke the screen within  days of having it but that has  that is my fault even if it has  it is a little more delicate than expected,neutral
all accessories attached were not original the computer connection did not work and the headphone and mic are so badthe telephone freezes if you try to work with it while charging the charger is not original either,neutral
i love it but gets heated fast and turns offthe head set goes off so when you make a call it has to be in speaker modei say they need to recall this phone cuz im on the nd and i just dont feel likeexchangein any more,neutral
phone works fine but battery does not hold charge for long the phone has to be charged every day after a few months of use,neutral
this phone is a good phone runs on att g lte in my area but would have been a great phone if it had more ram not a bad buy if you need a temp phone while yours is being repaired,neutral
fair over allproduct work good no problem thank you i would grade you a plus of course i would recomended,neutral
phone works fine but went through the run around to get a sim card nothe phone does not come with one luckily i was able to get one from apple because sprint does not have them to give to customers,neutral

was not unlocked,neutral
nice case just has too many groves where dirt and things can get caught and make it look dirty and old i returned it,neutral
great phone as advertised shipping is great will recommend,neutral
a bit bulky but not surprising hard to use fingerprint scanner due to the case shape but you get used to it overall ,neutral
it seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves who break the phones box seal open the box and unlock the phones themselves note that samsung says do not accept if seal is broken hence technically most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new i bought a lot of samsung galaxy s edge phones from amazon and most not all had the seal brokenon the phone itself this is the best phone i have ever tried slick light balanced fantastic screen fast water proof and so on  its only caveat and an important one is the lack of removable battery samsung lost the removable batter starting with the s i like this phone much better than the edge the s edge has a bigger screen but the resolution is the same as with the s and its edges are highly annoying making one touch them by mistake constantly furthermore the edges edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case  not a problem with the regular sfinally the only difference between the gf single sim version and the gfd dual sim version is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card which is recognized by the devices os,neutral
great smart watch,neutral
first of all i hate when there are a bunch of great reviews from people who received the phone for free to give a review i wish amazon would not allow thisas for the phone  i want to start by saying that i do not need a super charged ultra special high functionality smartphone i had a samsung galaxy s and did not think it was worth the money since i do not really stream things and i just use it for calls texting pictures and emailsim not a techie but im also not nave about technology i knew i was getting a subpar phone for the good the camera is really amazing it put the camera on my samsung galaxy s to shame especially the front facing camera i loved the quality of these pictures fantastic beautiful clear detailed high quality pictures for a  phone i spent  on my galaxy s and it paled in comparison the size and weight of the phone was perfect very light very thin and fir very well in my hand i have shorter fingers and have a hard time with phones that are too wide this phone was perfect for my hands love the color options i ordered pink and it was super cute speed was fine not issues at all for what i was doing lots of the features that the s had dual sim card slots is a great optionthe bad states that you can use up to a  gb micro sd card and i put mine in however the phone could not read any of my files from the card i could not listen to my music pull up my ring tones or see my photos i searched and searched the blu websitesupport online and the manual on the phone that links to their website and there was no troubleshooting help listed i tried downloading different apps that might allow me to see the files and nothing i do not know if it was a defective phone or if the phone just does not read certain types of files but if that is the case this needs to be laid our very specifically for people when they are purchasing this was a deal breaker for me when i would talk on the phone via the handset attach the wired headset that comes with the phone and use the bluetooth headset that i have used for a while my calls all appeared to be clear and sound great but the people i was talking to said that i continued to intermittently fade out and sound blurry this is without moving around and in the same service area as i have been in before with no issues and have not had issues since i stopped using the phone so must be the phone when talking on the handset the screen goes crazy it does not black out you have to physically turn it off otherwise your call might be placed on hold hung up on or random apps might open this has not happened to me with other phones so it has  it is not like im a phone idioti really had high hopes for this phone as my low cost low expectation phone and the good almost outweighed the bad almost i am returning the phone because of the issues with quality of calls and the sd card issues too bad because it otherwise seemed like the perfect phone for me,neutral
dear to whom it may concern that the iphone charger for the walk jack are way to big that i could not be able plug it in on my house jack so is there a way that you could send me another one that would be a able to plug in my wall jack and be able to charge my phone,neutral
great smart watch,neutral
phone works well with one exception quite often i get a display saying either sim card removed and requires a reboot or sd card was removedim watching this condition to see if it becomes chronic in which case i will be forced to take advantage of my year warranty by the way gold contacts on sd and sim have been cleaned and reseatedif you have any alternative suggestions i would certainly welcome them,neutral

 update i want to do a quick comparison between the nokia c and android phones specifically samsung nexus s by google ive been using the google android phone for the past  months and it did everything i needed it to do from paying for starbucks coffee using a starbucks app so i did not need to carry my starbucks card around and accessing multiple ms exchange accounts to the interface and os being slick and nimble as well as google directionsmappinggps the major downside to smartphones such as android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the os and display especially i could not last more than  hours on android and this is with setting the display to the lowest brightness at all times which is a pain when outdoors in bright sunlight that was the only issue with my android anyway it did everything i needed so i stuck with it until recently the sounds stopped working so i sold it and now i am back with nokia the strength of nokia is the battery lasts a good  hours on standby not sure why this amazon description states  days or so no  hours so at the end of the day before going to bed you need to charge it up again for the next day i can only add one ms exchange email account on nokia and i also have gmail installed the os is not as slick and fast as android and there is a white screen lag but you put up with it the sounds ringing call quality and reliability of the nokia as a phone first and foremost is second to none the android samsung had low ringing volume even at maximum also sprint service for the android was weak in my area so att under nokia was better the nokia is a workhorse of a phone that is loud volume i like and does a barely ok job at being a smart phone i will keep using it for now because of long battery life and i can switch out the sim card to my flip phone using the same data plan for traveling using a small flip phone esp overseas like europe att only charges  month for unlimited data since it is not considered a smart phone versus minimum  for smart phone will i eventually switch to a smart phone when something i like comes out yes of course the android experience except for battery life did everything i needed a smartphone to do rich apps for banking starbucks etc and my lifestyle what will i look for in a smart phone next time strong battery life easily lasting  hours on standby or basically what i call a whole day before charging at night loud ringer and volume g capability handle multiple ms exchange email accounts update bought this phone in september  there is still a slight lag in the form of a white screen in between applications but other than this and the slight heft weight to the phone it is a good sized pull out keyboard phone for a while the ovi maps and ovi store apps did not work i finally figured out i needed to delete the old files from apps manager and redownload ovi maps and ovi store the trick is it is a catch  you cannot download ovi maps with ovi store the pc sync did not work for me in the first place and you cannot if ovi store did not work i finally went to the browser and searched download ovi store and did it that way and once i go ovi store working downloaded ovi maps and then everything works now the music was a trick you need to sync to your pc and copy and paste to the c after created a music folder then in the c press music and then library and then options and then refresh the list and then your copied and pasted music will show up otherwise you will be figuring out why it does not show up after a while you need to manually refresh the music libraryi added somore more apps like a flashlight and games etc it is  working and a nice little phone however my main phone is a samsung nexus s g from sprint because it is a pure google experience on android it is faster and smoother and because i rely on gmail and google calendar and google everything apps it just works for me this c is a travel phone for me for example i also have a motorola ming a flip phone i used in europe and the c will also be a travel phone for me when i do not need to take my larger nexus s g with me traveling so the c is powered off all set up and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip the last time i took it i went to idaho and oregon on business because the battery life on the c lasts a whole day the flip phone ming a was even better a few days battery the nexus s g i charge every night and cannot beat the apps and user experience on nexus srecommendation is  stars now from  stars i would recommended it but would advise of the heft and the white screen everything works on it though but with ms exchange you can only add one email address so i have a ms exchange address and a gmail address which is basically what i need for email update had this phone for a few weeks now the white screen between switching screens etc is getting annoying now for  or so i paid for this phone i expect a faster processor i am changing my stars from  to  i would not buy this if i knew how annoyingly this white screen would bei am reviewing nokia c here first since i had time to play with it i will review the n soon in a bit under the n product site on amazon i reviewed the n on  so look for it under my kingmonkey id the c    i could not decide between nokia n and c did not want new n coming out end of september  since there was no physical keyboard so i bought both n and c phones do not come with a case to hold which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs for some reason nokia only sells oem cases for these phones to the european market if you go to amazon uk site or nokia eu site you will see cases made for n and c so i had to go to amazon uk site to order an oem case for n the c on nokia eu site has some nice ones but could not find them on amazon uk and on nokia eu site i cannot order them online being from the usa as you need to go to a retail location in europe anyway got some generic case more like a pouch for the c from amazon ukthe c is a nice looking stylish phone good size phone not too thick or long at all it has  it is fairly small and fits in your shirt pocket if you are a guy made of quality materials and feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone and also when you slide the keyboard out it is stiff and not moving about the top row keyboard key is a little close to the top half of the phone so when you type your thumb hits the top and gets in the way not a deal breaker for me as i just learn to adapt those with bigger hands fingers may find the keyboard a little cramped but i wanted a smaller smart phone compared to the other ones out there such as samsung galaxy or motorola droid so it is expected to be smaller overall as that is part of the appeal physically that was the only issue again nokia is stylish smart looking and as always love their nokia ringtone theme one last thing on the physical side being a middle of the road phone between n and lower end nokia phones it doe snot have al of the bells and whistles hence the lower price one feature i wish it had like the more higher end n is a camera lens cover the camera is just exposed to dust etc the c does come with a factory screen protector and since this is a new phone and you cannot buy a screen protector just yet i suggest leaving it on to protect the screen since after i set up the c the screen protector is scratched from my use of the phone normal use with fingers swiping back and forth mind you i take care of my nice things gently putting it down wrapping it in napkin until my pouch comes in the mail wash my hands and dry them no lotion before i handled my phone so even with all of this the screen still gets scratched slightly if you look at it at an angle anyway will need to buy a screen protector when they are available and hopefully the one that came with it will laston the software side the gb microsd chip only holds the california map and voice navigation street names  male voice both for us as two separate files that has  that is about gb total if you want all of us and other countries need to buy a gb microsd but even with this not sure if it can hold all the maps as you will need to delete some still as some maps are several gigsi think gb additional gigs is the limit the c can handle for a microsd card i do not travel a lot outside of california so it does the job and do not need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now i can wait until i need it and by then the microsd card price will go downthe other major issue is i use google calendar right now you can use ms exchange to set up google mail calendar and contacts but it imports all of my gmail contacts into my c even though i do not actively keep in touch with all of them i suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts do not remember if this is an option the calendar also only updates my main calendar so others i created including holidays calendars bill due date calendars etc do not get imported this was a deal breaker for me so i deleted this newly createdadded gmail account and all of the contacts and email and calendar got deleted which is what i wanted and it went back to how it was being empty by the way when you import this way any contacts or information you had in the calendar gets overridden with the new import so my one contact i created with a photo and all got overridden with the import i had to reenter it anyway my workaround is to use instead of ms exchange option on nokia to add google accounts like gmail and calendar etc i used the gmail option via the email icon to set up the email account and it works well as for google calendar there is a google mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for google calendar so for my internet application i set my default homepage as the google calendar address so when i want to look at all holidays bills color coded too of my google calendars i just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by google as for the ovi calendar do not use it maybe ill look at it just to see what day it is every sooften so i get my google calendar but via a webpage site not the ovi calendar because like i said the ms exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar no other calendars created as discussed abovei also downloaded ovi software to my pc and the linking between the c and ovi software on my pc works well this is how you sync the photos maps contacts etc from your pc to the c also faster way to update your c with software updates since you download them from the pc first and then link your c to the pc via a usb cable and the data transfer is faster otherwise you would have to do it over airwaves on the c which is slower even using g but you can connect to wifi if available using the ci customized my desktop icons which is pretty cool i added a couple rows of frequent contacts then rd row from top gmail then a couple row of shortcuts below such as web access a bookmarked web page calc camera last row has messaging icon then i downloaded an app for messaging including google talk from the ovi app store by searching for messagingit has  it is called nimbuzz and with this you choose your account type google talk yahoo messenger whatever    at first i was lookign and looking for google talk app but it does not exist you have to access google talk through this rd party app nimbuzz or something else equivalent it was a free app and it works perfectly fine the c home screen iconsbeing symbian software based is a bit cartoonish when compared to more sophisticated phones like the n or droid icons or blackberry  bold but it has  it is fine and the learning curve is not steep to learn to master the c menu and navigation as discussed aboveoverall i am happy with the nokia good size small bar type smart phone good looking quality materials the c is symbian based and my n is maemo based so another reason i bought both to compare and see how i like them c works with att g so since i have an existing att sim card it works great the n i signed up for a tmobile individual plan textwebvoice and the n g only works with tmobile g so i am set here if i used the att sim card the att g does not work with nokia n and would have to settle for edge non g email me at darianchin at gmail dot com if you have questions,neutral

i was looking for the phone with qwerty keyboard and motorola photon q g has a very nice keyboard probably the best among all phone keyboards i have used there is a one little problem which was the show stopper for me the keyboard outputs duplicated characters very often when i press the letter key the keyboard outputs  or more same characters i am not sure if this is the problem with hardware or with android  which this phone has i actually needed to revert to the onscreen keyboard while loging to the google since was not able to enter the correct password after several attempts so what is good about the phone with qwerty keyboard if you not able to use it so finally phone was returned and it is unfortunately since i liked it,neutral

great phone,neutral
it has  it is idiotic the way they placed the volume down button right when your thumb naturally goes so that when you grip the phone in a normal manner you accidentally turn the volume way down and the next thing you know you are not receiving calls because the darned ringer is turned off really a stupid design my other complaint is that the camera is inferior to what i had in my htc one also i find that with this galaxy  it has  it is not as easy to use voice as opposed to typing as on my old phone it does have some nice features though as far as easy access to favorites an alphabetical shortcut to contacts and a few other things i do not like the cover on the charging spot and fine it a real pain having to always flip up the little cover and it has  it is quite difficult to get the darned usb end propertly lined up if you are not using the dedicated extrawide charger cord,neutral

bought the c in apr and now a year later the the screen does not work im told its either the screen or the flex cable but either way i have send it to a nokia shop to get it sorted out when i figure out what im going to do ill post an update ive been an exclusive nokia user for  years now so maybe its time for a changeive loved this phone even before i got it it looks cool it feels good in your hand its comfortable to type on and the touch screen works the c is built solid its taken quit a few falls and kept on ticking which is probably why its not working now there are not many options of covers for the c and the silicone covers which are good for falls interfere with the proximity sensors some times the camera is good better in sunlight video is ok but not the best i usually power up every  days the processorapps can slow down at times but its not a big issue i have issues downloading apps from ovi because of my location the caribbeanthe best thing about nokia phone is the nokia suit i have hundreds of contacts and media but i can easily move my content from  phone to another using this suit this is one of the reasons ive been with nokia this long that and the solid build of the phones even with the screen not working i was able to download all my content from the phone so i have not lost anything,neutral

they sent me a used phone when i payed for a new one again it was used if you are knowledgeable about this phone you know it has a fingerprint scanner to unlock it let me put emphasis on that word again used it was basically a  paper weight right out of the box there is no way of getting into it if the fingerprint scanner is used i give this phone itself a  star rating because though i had no way of opening it to really get to know the phone i found that it is absolutely theft proof and it obviously did it has  it is job on that part it also feels really sturdy and seems very well designed i will be returning it that is if the vendor does not try to scam me be careful,neutral

ive waited a long while to make sure this review was as accurate as i could make it i got a lot of emails pushing me to review it right away but i think that might be amazons thing and not the sellershipping packaging shipping was lovely on time as expected everything was nice and shiny no damaged boxes or plasticphone case before you decide to purchase this product make sure you have another case coming in along with it the brittle plastic case is atrocious and broke the very first day i had it i tried very carefully to pull the case off to show a friend the entire phone and it splintered off at the top almost half a year and i pretty much have half a phone case leftphone cord im still in awe at how durable this baby is really after being stuck with an iphone for several years of my life with constant fraying cords this was a breath of fresh air zero fraying zero hiccups from the phone to my computer my only complaint is that mine seems to come unplugged fairly easily from my phone it has  it is not as snug as it should be if you are not an active person or if you leave your phone on a flat surface as it charges or it has  it is plugged up to your pc you should be finephone cord plug the plug for this is seemingly durable so far it seems to like to heat up however after being plugged in for a while so far it has  it is been fine but i would suggest keeping an eye on it just in case if you are going to leave it plugged in for long periodsscreen protector it surprised me how easily and quick this film went on i have a good few tiny bubbles in there but nothing i cannot work around my main concern was whether or not it would protect the screen i have received a single scratch on my phone and the screen did indeed do it has  it is job keep in mind that it has  it is a very thin flimsy film if you are active you may want to think twice about accepting the one that comes in the boxphysical phone this phone in particular seems to like to heat up a lot on me ive heard people complain about their phones burning them before but this is not quite the case i leave my phone laying flat on my stretched bed sheet with nothing surrounding it after a little while i can pick it up and it will be very very warm i would not put it in my purse because of this and leaving it in my pockets for long periods of times has not been something ive consideredmy friend and i were worried about how thin the phone was when i first got it i would not say it has  it is durable in a sense where it would be okay to drop it a lot but i can say that if you drop it you probably have just as much risk of breaking it as the next phone it has  it is not a delicate snowflake it is lighter than the phones ive used in the past but i do not feel like it has  it is going to slip out of my hands or anythingthe camera ive only used a few times im more used to using an iphone and have the camera immediately adjust when you touch the screen if you are transitioning this might be a little frustrating for you ive found that the camera picks up my shaky hands easily and most of my photos come out with a slight blurim using tmobiles sim starter kit in mine i have not had but a single problem and it was completely user errorsound on this particular phone however frustrates me im a little hard of hearing and even on speaker phone it seems to be fairly quiet even when turned all the way upbattery life for the most part depending on how actively im using my phone i can have it charged for the most of my day using it actively however it seems to drop fairly quick even on dim lighting and nothing running in the background and i mean quick by a few hours not minutes like some harsh cases im normally only chatting and surfing the web i cannot really account for music or videosos this phone love love loves to reboot whenever it likes ive lost a few phone calls one during a sales exchange to the phone up and deciding that it was done with letting me speak for a little while im not sure if it does this while i sleep it may only be while im using iti wont complain about the lack of reasonable included apps or themes but i will forewarn you about the awful bloatware included the first thing i did when i turned on my phone was delete the extra promotional apps that id never be usingi do love how nice the connection is my friend measured her connection compared to mine on her blu phone and she was instantly jealous and started to consider replacing her own currently i am not in the position to relook up those numbers again forgive meverdictthis phone is doable if it were to die right this moment from my own doing i would not repurchase it this was my first phone that was not an iphone and i was excited to try it out dig my teeth into it see what i had been missing not taking into account that this phone has made me question whether or not i like phones outside of iphone i find this phone very frustrating at times which is not what i want from something that i use as an extension of myselfif a friend asked me about it i would tell them that it has  it is an okay buy but i would not suggest itonce i have better internet connection i will include photos of the case,neutral
there is little contrast between the letters and the background when writing messages  should improve this aspect of the phone in addition it is impossible to graduate the volume during the call although this is a useful phone if you want something simple  calls and messages and at low cost,neutral
some of the tab placements are a bit eccentricim uncertain as to the battery lifeit went dead on me after  hours in one instance,neutral
good phone the only problem is that you can barley hear the other side sometimes and the battery runs out quick,neutral

i bought a unlocked phone simply because i live on a budget the booklet that come along with the phone does not answer some of the more advance questions i wanted some information about cloud storage and when you call customer service well they do not have any answers it is an ok phone it does the basics well im not really all that impressed but it is ok for the price,neutral

it has  it is a great phone with annoying issueswhat i like about the phonehas the best display on a budget phone and can go head to head with any flagship phonehas great speakers and audio experience this phone sounds better than a lot of the flagships out there the speaker and headset port produce some great sound this phone easily competes with all the flagships in the audio category and beats if not all than mostgps alcatel got it right it has  it is so hard to find an android phone with flawless gps performance this phone locks on in quickly and is pretty accurate the moto g is pretty good in this regard as well my galaxy s  phone has issues with gps performancebattery you can easily make it through the day again this beats my s but not as good as a note  for the price it beats a lot of flagships in the battery categorywhat i do not like mostly software issuescell reception it has  it is worse than my old galaxy s s and note i can easily get lte on my other phones and this phone barely gets hdspa sometimes drops to edge the download speed is slower but what annoys me the most is when im in a good area and the phone sticks on hdspa and does not switch to lte i noticed that this happens much more often when my radio is set to ltewcdmagsm more than ltewcdma so i have to manually switch it by going into the test settings through dial codesbrightness for some reason randomly the phone will dim all the way randomly even with auto brightness turned off me being outside and the display set to full brightness which can make following directions or reading something outside very annoyingbackground audio sometimes when i watched a youtube video put it on pause and turned off the display get a notification and the youtube video starts playing with the screen still off it has  it is annoying and another software bug youtube is not the only application to do this for me most applications do thisdouble tap turn it off too many butt dials with the feature turned onso great hardware but there are some software issues im checking for updates every day i really want to keep this device but my old cheaper moto g did not have any of these issues i think alcatel has a great device but for some reason way too many software bugs that needed to be ironed out before launch,neutral

i ordered this a few weeks ago and was really excited about receiving it coincidentally the day before my n arrived nokia released a new firmware update so the first thing i did was update the software on my n to the latest versionduring the update process i noticed the usb port on the phone itself seemed loose but thought nothing of it after the update was done i began to use the phone and i ended up returning it to amazon the next day you have seen all the positive reviews so i will not rehash that but here are why i returned it the usb port on my n was extremely loose or broken you had to apply a lot of pressure and push the cable in and then not touch it for it to stay connected it was so loose that a breeze from the window could disconnect the device from the pc i tried several usb cables computersports with no success the usb transfer speed is horrific for a device that comes with gb it took almost  hours to transfer about gb of music to the device using windows media player using mass storage mode is just as slow since this uses usb  fullspeed old spec not usb  highspeed common today no matter what people tell you this is absolutely frustrating and annoying over time even if you do not transfer stuff much the slider on the phone is wobbly and whenever i pressed a button on the keypad it made a creaking sound that i do not expect from a  phone it did not feel solid at all at least not my n the overall size of the device is surprisingly small but the thing is as thick as a brick which makes it awkward to carry in your pant pocket or worse jeans pocket even without really installing any apps on it the thing would randomly slow down and not respond to key presses and then just wake up all of a sudden it was bizarre does not charge via usb not used to this so was annoying that you have to at times have both a usb cable and nokia charger plugged ini ended up getting a nokia n us g that was just recently released and im extremely happy with it it addresses most if not all of the issues i had with the n including fastest usb fast cpuresponsive excellent build qualityi would recommend looking at the n or the upcoming n successor to n over the n,neutral

i bought this device from wireovia about two weeks ago end of november  i had another one bought from europe that i used for a few months before giving it to my wife and obviously i was happy with it since i bought another onethis particular device i got has quite an old software installed it has android  with htc sense  while the last version available is android  and htc sense  it works as expected as a phone signal strength volume but it could do more as a smartphone android experiencefrom the first  minutes i enabled wireless it started downloading software updates first it downloaded and successfully installed two fota updates immediately after that it tried to download a system update and this is where the trouble begins it successfully downloaded the mb system updated but it failed to apply it i tried that a few times and it failed the same way every time i asked wireovia what to do and they told me to ask for support at htcive just spent one hour on the line with htc us support trying different stuff they told me this particular device is an overseas uk version they also told me that it looks like the phone it has  it is trying to download the software update from their website but the update is not there and this is why it fails i did not understand exactly what is it downloading since the update is not there but it still download some mbs anyway if i want it updated id have two options either wait for the update to become available on the website do not know when that will happen or send it to htc so that they update it obviously the second option would cost me something money  for shipping to them time  since it has  it is an overseas version they would have to ask for the update in the ukthe conclusion would be that there is a reason why there is no warranty available for this phone do not get me wrong it has  it is not like it has  it is broken but it could do more for the same money,neutral
i bought  blackberry curve  without problem received them only bad thing is that the boxes in which they come are old and battered as plastics are scratched phones do not understand the reason for this seems to be that the boxes were heavily manipulated but the phones are good for the operation of them,neutral

overall the blu smartphone works well and the phone itself sounds clear and sharp when using phone normally or on speaker apps load fast on wifi or cellular signal has nice  inch screen measured diagonally  x  inch view screen and fits well in ones hand also you can add additional memory and have two sim card slots to use one sim card for personal use and another sim card for business or foreign travel use you also have google play to add you favorite apps and connect to pc without additional apps to add music and photos to your phone now the negatives minor does not have call blocker or hides you number if you wanted you have to find an app to do that calendar app is basic and does not have to many options you can find better apps in google play major concerns there is no updates at present for the android ios which on this phone is  version also moving some apps to sd memory causes app short cut on screen to disappear when the phone is shut off or restarted had to contact support to simi fix problem certain apps still have the disappearing problem after the fix maybe my sd card is not compatible or bad still doing tests on it also phone goes into diagnostic mode at startup a couple of time since i had it which is about a month am working with support on this issue overall the phone works very well has good reception and an average user should not worry about using up the battery to fast can save battery for several days of use if only using phone and apps separatingly you can also buy an extra battery for heavy user or get a portable battery charger for smartphones has a profile similar to the new samsung smartphone slim and looks good,neutral
this has been pretty handy for a low cost unlocked smart phone there are a few disappointments that i have not figured out yet like my cars can no longer read my phone book or read my text messages to me so now when im driving if i do not know a number i cannot make a call i miss knowing what texts were coming in and being able to respond through the voice features in my car the camera is hit or miss i find i have a lot more disappointing blurry photos with this camera than with my nokia lumia also despite all the settings available to manipulate the camera i find that im just not able to get decent shots most of the time like i could on my lumia there are some fun instagram like filters built into the editing software but a better quality picture to start with would be nice having access to android apps has been nice and i love how thin this phone is the color is fun too for the price it had everything i needed in the box call quality is good and the screen is bright and clear overall it has  it is been better than i expected for the price,neutral
bought this for my mother it performs well but the camaraderie at nights does not give clear pictures in the daylightsunlight it looks like an upscale phone took the pictures but the night light gives it challenges for great pictures due to small pixels it comes with but it does everything else if youremail afraid of losing an expensive phone but you want great service this would be good if also they break phone screens often but should still be tech say get this phone as practice,neutral

absolutely love the concept of this phone but ultimately i had to return it only because the battery simply was inadequate i do not do a lot of social media or apps but still the battery seems to barely last  hours however on the positive side i love the size of this thing and im so exasperated by phone manufacturers designing bigger and bigger phones kudos to posh for building this and hopefully in future products they will improve battery performance,neutral

if you are buying this for the gps function think again as many others have commented it takes forever for this phone to figure out where it is that makes it pretty useless for around the town driving in addition it has a pathetic accuracy level it regularly told me that i was  yards from a turn when i was already in the left turn lane and only  feet from the intersection suddenly it realized where it was and told me to turn leftin addition the gps works much better if it is agps which uses your phone network as a part of its navigation process that uses up valuable minutes on my phone service that i am not interested in donating to att that has  that is especially significant because we want a gps for long voyages you can use it without the agps but it has  it is not nearly as goodbeyond the gps the phone is astonishing the screen is gorgeous and watching movies on it is a blast it sounds good and it has  it is easy to use others have complained about the interface but i do not think it has  it is a problem if you do not care about the gps then buy it in a second oh the wifi is blazing fast as fast as my new laptop almost and the resolution is great,neutral
good phone but do not recommend third party seller,neutral
i bought two of these phones because i wanted to surprise my friends who were going away on a trip and both of them needed new phones i looked at many different smart phones on here specifically with g lte which in itself narrows the selection this phone stood out to me the price seemed ok the specs sounded fine and the reviews were encouraging so i bought two i was excited about getting them and giving them away but the joy of the surprise did not last very long both phones have inaccurate sensors if i tap a letter in the top row it gives me language selection i need four sometimes five attempts to open an app because it does not respond to lighter touch it becomes extremely annoying when you type a message and it frequently inserts a suggestion just because you typed the letter slightly upward even for a budget phone like this one i expected better adjustment i also could not like in my own phone which was the same price but seems a much better quality calibrate the sensor to have a more accurate typing experience there was no way to fix thisas i gave the two phones away the frustration was high as i felt i had made a bad choice i am returning at least one of them and have already ordered a phone of which i know that it worksthere is some good about these phones however the wifi is relatively fast and the phone itself is fast in opening apps for example the screen is very clear and almost looks like a retina screen very high quality the colors are vibrant this phone comes with a screen protector and a slim silicone case all of that is absolutely great and i like that the sellers do sell a product with thought behind it but all the good does not help if the one thing that makes a phone useable being able to type or press on a symbol is not working well,neutral

the phone was a good price arrived promptly and was packaged well as a phone it functions fine two things that drive me a little crazy first the camera is horrible the photos are grainy and fuzzy i thought  megapixels would produce clearer photos than my iphone s  megapixels but it does not i cannot deposit checks with my phone because the banks app can not read the picture it has  it is too blurry the other is when im typing a text or an email i often hit the button on the bottom that brings you back to the main screen i guess this is something i need to get used to,neutral
this is a solid case with a good lip to protect the screen when sitting face down however it is extremely slippery and i often set the phone down onto the table and it slides  inches short of that it is a solid case with above average protection for the money i would prefer it if the back of the case had some material to prevent it from being as slippery,neutral

my coworkers tell me constantly that blackberry does not hold a position in the upper echalon of cell phone society but i am ok with that my blackberry curve purchased from my cellular provider was dropped from the top of a ten foot ladder close to forty times onto a concrete floor no case and no not intentionally and it still kept going not even a cracked screen so when my husband who works in construction was ready to make the move to a smartphone blackberry seemed the logical choice lightning speed an impressive list of apps and cool video games did not make the short list but durability was key his blackberry curve  also purchased from our cellular provider served him well for two years when it finally gave up the ghost mine is still plugging away he opted for a replacement rather than learning a new phone  the only problem was that our provider no longer had a contract with blackberry we had to purchase an unlocked phone elsewhere so i puchased this onethe phrase in the header no warranty should have been a red flag but my experience with blackberry over more than  years dissuaded me after only three months this phone developed issues it locked up to the point that either the trackpad would work but not the keys or viceversa we attempted powering down hard reboot utilizing blackberry desktop manager software and a reset to factory default settings no joy off to our cellular provider we went and my husband is now learning a new phonesome may think that three stars for a phone that only worked three months is a bit generous but i am taking into consideration blackberrys track record my extreme loyalty to blackberry and the fact that my husband is very tough on phones before his move to a smartphone he was going through about two flip phones each year this curve  appears to have fixed itself as now everything seems to be working again it is however offnetwork so i cannot confirm this i will keep it charged and hang on to it just in case mine goes wonky then i will know for sureone thing i would like to mention while trying to breathe life back into this phone by pulling the back cover battery sim and sd card then replacing them i did notice that it was a bit squeaky and clicky meaning it did not fit together as solid as my phone from my cellular provider  there was more play in how it all fit together  mine fit tightly with no clicks or squeaksmy bottom line i am a loyal fan of blackberry but the phrase no warranty should probably play into your decision if you are considering this item for purchase,neutral

bought this for my mother it performs well but the camaraderie at nights does not give clear pictures in the daylightsunlight it looks like an upscale phone took the pictures but the night light gives it challenges for great pictures due to small pixels it comes with but it does everything else if youremail afraid of losing an expensive phone but you want great service this would be good if also they break phone screens often but should still be tech say get this phone as practice,neutral

okay i do not write a lot of reviews but let us give this a shotfirst off i love the lg g the phone is a beast it has  it is fast and it has  it is everything i needwant in a phone and more battery drain was insane for the first couple of days and then settledstabilizedas for kraymerica well i do not know how i feel their customer service is been pretty awesome they respond quickly and are willing to work with you however first phone that i got had some minor scruffs on the metal edging of the phone minor defects but still you are paying that much for a phone you expect it to be perfect out of the box i contacted the company and they took  off of my initial price which i thought was more than fair i then also experienced some speaker issues while on a call it has  it is nothing on my end but other callers ive tested and experienced this myself hear echo and just overall noise ive read this may just be an lg g issue experienced by some and could be caused by an app after installing factoring resetting phone after phone to get to where im at this is just not something im willing to do againkraymerica sent me another phone on the promise i would send back the original again more than reasonable second phone looked great appearance wise i was setting it up and loving it did not even experience that initial battery drain but alas another problem arose it failed to recognize my sandisk ultra  gb micro sd card the first phone had no issue with this after some debate i decided to purchase another type of sd card samsung evo  gb just to see if it was the phone being picky about cards or what welp it failed to read that second sd card as wellhad to send back the second phone and ultimately decided to keep the original so it was a lot of wasted time and effort that i had to deal with neither phone was perfect so somethings wrong here they claim these phones are being tested before being sent out for sale but someone is dropping the ball hereagain love the phone aside from these issues and the minor cosmetic defects and great company as far as customer service cannot give higher than  stars though with  out of  phones giving me issues,neutral

this phone has some very nice features the down side is concerning the volume you will have to use an earpiece even the external speaker is hard to hear during moments with low to moderate background noise most times the earpiece will not stay paired and then you just have to shut off the blue tooth then turn it back on but sometimes it will not allow you to shut the blue tooth off and back on then you have to reboot the phone the battery is not removable and you cannot add memory the battery life should have been better even after making sure nothing else is running the battery seems to drain fast the wireless display is awesome and works very well i can stream movies and video to my television you can set the alarm and shut the phone off and it will automatically start itself to activate the alarm im not totally happy with it but i am somewhat satisfied as long as you are informed on what you are getting the choice of buying makes the decision easier,neutral

there is a lot to like about the phone but there are a variety of issues too most importantly this phone has a problem with touchscreen sensitivity in the lower part of the screen when the phone is not held in hand it is particularly bad on some surfaces such as on a bed also the problem gets much worse if you install a glass protective screen it starts being very noticeable on almost all surfacesive made a quick demonstration video about the issue see below other users have reported this issue with their phone it is a design defect by sony surprisingly it appears to affect only the white version of the phone it does heat up quite a lot during normal use like updating apps or watching videos and the battery is drained faster than on previous version that i have z compact i did not see any improvement in photo quality compared to the old z in fact some pics look worse in identical settings at the same time there is a substantial improvement in focusing and in video quality,neutral

the phone i received was in great condition except for one small scratch in the upper corner however the phone was locked to the original users apple id so there is no way for me to access this phonei was satisfied with the condition but very disappointed that amazon did not wipe the phone entirely and therefore i could not use it at all i researched buying a phone from amazon and thought that it would be safe just a word of caution that this does happen sometimes,neutral
description stated  brand new in original retail box phone has original plastic screen with all accessories have original packaging the phone i received was not in retail package it was a generic htc package and the phone did not even have the plastic wrap there was a sticker in the back of the phone nb  research on the internet comes up as new breed refurbished phone inspected on  there is no warranty information nor user manual i opted to buy this phone as the order was fulfilled by amazon the phone did not have any visible damage and so far in the past  days i did not have issues and the windows update went well this is why im keeping this phone there is always a disappointment when you receive the product not per the description so buyers keep this in mind while ordering you can easily find factory refurb models else where for around  or less,neutral

i bought this phone for my yearold daughter the observations and opinions expressed in this review are herswhat she likes does not drop calls often compared with other tmobile phones good sound quality twistflip screen is coolwhat she does not like bulky does not ring or vibrate until at least  minutes after a text message has arrived menu controls and navigation are confusing obsolete data network editing the speed dial number list is undocumented and counterintuitivethe sidekick is loaded with personalization features but they are accessed in a complex counterintuitive and poorly documented menu system my daughter has had it for a couple months now and still has trouble changing settings the phone depends on tmobiles extinct danger network for obtaining the correct date and time so it is necessary to manually change the time when traveling between time zones the phone can work well for people who communicate mainly via text messaging but note that the phone does not alert the user immediately when a message arrives mostly call the same  speed dial numbers but people who frequently have to dial new phone numbers will find the process cumbersomethis sidekick model was an early smartphone with many text email web and networkbased features however with the demise of tmobiles danger network most of these features no longer work on this phone the only features that still work are the basic voice text and email services supported by tmobiles standard gsm networkdespite these drawbacks it works well as an inexpensive phone for a preteenager,neutral

first at  this item should have qualified for free shipping but i was charged over  shsecondly the ad did not state this was an international version which required a european sim card to make it work i discovered this only when it arrived fortunately i managed to borrow a german sim card from a distant friend to wake up the phone only then could i use an american tmobile sim card that was a false and misleading adthe phone itself is ok i just did not appreciate being put to all that trouble to make it work,neutral
battery fail,neutral
the people i bought it from had everything in the package as it stated including the sim card so it was a new unit the unit itself has a limited android as it is  and needs a upgrade the phone itself is nice enough as it does not have a option of downloading apps as only you can get those compatible for this phone unless your on the android market to get them my brother has a lg phone and his phone has alot more options than this phone the call quality however is good and the web has g speed which is ok if i known this i would have spent a little more for those type options with a better android version but i will keep this one for now as i am not totally happy with this unit the  mp phone is really nice and that is the best feature of the phone i have a couple of samsung products is the reason i bought the phone but wish it was not so limited and android market oriented as i would have like to have the capability of downloading apps to the phone from the computerif your new too androids its ok,neutral
i purchase this for my wife come with what it been advertisedthose who do not need the latest function in the market and you cannot beat it for this pricesuppose to be a  star phone just because sometimes the call will be drops still not sure my iphone or this phone well even my friends  htc will sometimes dial back and drops call,neutral
not much of an expert in writing reviews but i spent a lot of money on this thing while it definitely has its pluses like a gorgeous image it is too costly for its capabilitiesperformance i also have an iphone s plus and a nexus p which i am using in the exact same locations as the blu and both of those manage to keep the signal and help me make and receive calls sms andor data from inside of the federal building where i have my office in spite of the tons of iron in the way the blu craps out in terms of receiving signal as soon as i arrive at work sure a beautiful screen and all its bells and whistles are nice but what good is a freakinn phone if it cannot receive a signal where other phones work just fine so this one is being on its way to a new home i am sure there are plenty of people who do not work in buildings such as my work places but i am making potential buyers aware of these things frankly i should have given it even less stars because of its inability to receive signal in spite of its bulkwhich one would think should help by providing more room for a decent antenna or whatever these things use to make sure signals make it through to them wherever other brands are able to receive signal,neutral

first of all  this is not a phone with  gb internal memory it has only  gb memory in it when i stated to use with sd card  the device is not recognizing the micro sd card it wil show preparing the card for  mins and its getting stuckso at last i changed the firmware and updated with a custom rom longhorn  final and now every features are working camera as okay and just keep in mind that dell discontinued the streak  on as of august  so do not expect any kind of warranty use it at your own risk,neutral
overall i would give this phone  stars unfortunately it would turn off by itself constantly even when the battery was fully charged the only way that i could get it back on would be to remove and then reinsert the battery the touchscreen would freeze several times daily which also could only be resolved by removing and then reinserting the battery this phone has excellent features but crashes way too often and by that i mean daily if it were not for those issues i would have been very pleased with this phone overall most other functions worked well,neutral
this phone is by now outdated naturally but it has  it is still not such a bad phone the main reason i needed it was to connect to wireless networks on the go that this phone for some permanent and unsolved flaw does not do nor recognize by  at least of the available networks and all you get is no gateway reply that pertains to each one of es unless you have a plan but as far as wireless connection when needing it mostly it certainly fails to deliver the service needed or in other words it just malfunctions the screen is not so big likewise and the keyboard is hard to operateon due to it being small and crammed up making it difficult to implement operations fast gps is good but it takes around  minutes at least for it to start reading the satellite the reception of the voice is excellent as well as the battery life and if you need it only as a phone for talk only than you can go ahead and buy it but if you need something really reliable in a real sense of these current phones nowadays than this one is simply not the one to go ahead and make your day z,neutral

fairly disappointed with what i had come to expect from sony the phone itself is encased in plastic not metal and a lot easier damaged than their previous xperia phones the design is strange with different materials that do not exactly match with eachother on the ux side the phone is alright with the exception of what has  what is new a sony preinstalled app that cannot be removed and forces advertisements for stupid games,neutral

ok when i first turn on the phone and started to work it out i actually thought i was done with android well i still love the phones look however im finding more and more that not only it does not work as hoped but it has  it is clear that windows phone has a long way to go to be appreciated as android honestly most of the apps that i am used to simply do not work as smooth as i found them in android to make matter worse the phone is giving ominous signs of freezing up after just four months that has  that is unacceptable so i probably would not buy it again unless this one is perhaps defective but ill say it again it has  it is a beautiful phone in my opinion,neutral
quick ship and easy transaction the phone was as described condition the charger in the description was not for the phone sent that part did not make sense to me but the phone is really what i was after the corrct car charger would have been a big plus on this order,neutral
three star ratings to seller gsm nation for sending the new unlocked not att unlocked phone as described but its still has a polish carrier logo on start which means it still has the polish carrier software  settings with it the phone had its basic setup in polish lang but changed it to english without any issues,neutral
pretty good but the operating instructions are weak,neutral

it was a nice watch but unfortunately i had complications connecting it to my galaxy s edge plus,neutral
so far works fine,neutral
battery is not great has me wondering everything else seems fine,neutral
i would give this device  stars because i absolutely love it the design of the device along with the capabilities of the device but since i got this device which is a couple days ago i realized that i have to constantly charge it the battery life is really really poor for example last night i charged it at   before i went to bed only to wake up this morning and saw it at  which is not supposed to happen before i purchased this device the description clearly indicated that the battery on this device was outstanding i am yet to experience this this is very unsatisfying to me because i expected the device to operate seamlessly it also freezes from time to time can someone please contact me so we can discuss this issue,neutral
at first this phone was great the only problem i had with it was that the home button was loose and would often get stuck down causing siri to come on but other than that it worked well until one night i pulled it out of my purse and it said no service i thought it would just turn back on again but it would not let me call or txt i brought it into verizon and they told me they could not do anything for my phone and i would need to but a new phone for the full price after that i was very angry because i got this phone to replace a broken one and not even  weeks later it stops working but after talking to amazon and and the company that i bought the phone though they had me send back the phone and they gave me a refund im upset about the phone but i am thankful for good costumer care,neutral
i bought this for a travel phone it was way too small for easy use if you do not want to type anything then it would be fine but i am used to a smartphone and this just did not work for me i bought an acer phone in the munich airport and used that for my trip,neutral
bought this as a travel phone and served its purpose good for taking voice calls and listening to fm radio not ideal for texting no instructions with the phone i was not able to find the mechanism to lock the keys from accidental dialing,neutral
it is nice phone but the international version doesnt display or save miss call a big problem not sure if that is because of a specific settings,neutral
it has  it is a new phone but gave me trouble to come on even when it was fully charged too make it worse i cannot hear nothing when i receive and make out going calls plus i cannot listen to any audio or video on my phone i need to return this phone and get a refund asap what is the procedure,neutral
i had it for  day and it stop working but you get for you pay for,neutral
the one i bought has problem after i updated ios lucky it is under warranty so apple gave me a new one,neutral
the battery for this phone only stays charged about  to  hours so sometimes it has to be charged twice a day a real bummer ,neutral
it has  it is ok,neutral
i didnt like the fact that it has no option to lock i did pocket dial many times because it does not have lock,neutral
a bit too large almost broke clip trying to rate it,neutral
i like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that i can say other than that it is a good phone,neutral
love phone just hated getting different sims,neutral
there had been single vertical line in the display,neutral
this is a good phone for the money that being said the touch screen required me to press down fairly hard on it and does not always work rightsense my fingers the onscreen keyboard is difficult to type on because of this the screen is bright and vibrant and the camera works as expected the vibrator does not vibrate like a normal phone and seems cheap and cheesy lollipop to me is a disaster very counterproductive to anybody getting this phone i would recommend you switch to kitkat or something else if you can,neutral
this phone came to me brand new everything wrapped and sealed this phone is not a dual sim as the seller advertises and i am angry about that my nano sim fits in the primary slot and does not fit in the secondary slot even when fitted side ways on doing research i found the tray should say simmicrosd my tray says only microsdonly reason i bought from this seller because of high ratings and was fulfilled by amazoni will never again buy from this seller,neutral
i like this case but you can only fit a max of  cards in there,neutral
the battery life is so bad that i almost returned it but due to my business and need of a phone  i had to keep it ,neutral
as a novice user of this type of equipment i give it only a  star rating i have not experienced this type of phone and have been dramitacally challenged to learn how to use it it would be great if there were a beginners manual to teach all this phone has to offer at times i became so frustrated i simply had to put it down and walk away while i can use it for communication purposes i still know very little if anyone could direct me to a better way of learning instead of trial and error  i would much appreciate it,neutral
this is not really a smartphone and whoever designed it to satisfy all of us who love the little keyboard forgot there were other things on earlier blackberry models bold in particular we all liked these included quick add of appointments easy searching on the device from the main screen the most important mistake blackberry made with its new os  is to omit wifi calling on the classic this was the killer reason to have a blackberry and when tmobile is still working with blackberry to reintroduce this on classics on their network there has  there is something wrongafter nearly two months im getting used to the classic including how to manage the battery life so it lasts the whole day and use of data tmobile support has been helpful blackberry support has not been the transition is frustrating and despite the great cameras it has  it is not been easyif i had to do this again id buy a replacement bold,neutral
i would have prefered the balls with the color embedded in them i wish i had spent  bux more,neutral
i would have given it  stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and i bought the device to use on tmobile in which it was advertised forit had a verizon sticker on it but seems to work ok so far otherwise its a decent iphone and arrived on time through amazon prime which is a terrific service,neutral
the battery life is terrible if you use your phone at all for any reason the battery drains like there has  there is no tomorrow barely made it through  hours of work with  left only used it periodically to see the time,neutral
it could not send or receive mms,neutral
changing my review because it was not the seller it was the verizon dealer if you buy an unlocked phone make sure the seller has a clear imed number so you can switch easily this is important to be able to hook up the sim card the imed number was a bit scratched off,neutral
photo quality is good in daylight front camera is hopeless,neutral
resets every time to plug in err,neutral
i installed a sd card in this phone but the memory in this phone is always filling up and the phone unexpectedly delets all your downloaded apps,neutral
i would have given this purchase  star review but the charger usb cable and charger block are for a nokia phone normally not an issue but this phone battery requires a higher output of charging amps phone just will not charge to full capacity even after  hours other than that issue this refurbished phone is outstanding,neutral
great phone but the capacity of the memory is too low with a few apps downloaded it is full,neutral
it is not bad for the price i would reccommend it,neutral
nice looking phone it works well worth the price update i returned the phone after using for only a couple of days the phone overheats when charging and downloading updates there was a small mb update and the phone heated up to  f the back of the phone was very hot to the touch during a large update it would probably shut down or burn out at the least the life of the phone would be cut way short from the overheating also there is an extra button on the right bottom for the camera the camera would come on with the phone in my pocket this phone would be really good if those problems would be corrected,neutral
you could tell it was used before but it worked and that has  that is all i needed,neutral
front camera isa kool phone but cannot get tango on it why,neutral
when i call the screen shut off,neutral

purchased this phone to replace my old samsung behold phone this is my first day impressionpros good price for the phone most android phones cost over  and this one is below that it came with all the google apps you need the  screen is a reasonable size one of the samsung smartphones that actually comes with a flash and a front facing camera sd card is located at a very convenience location customizable in many different ways and wifi calling is very coolcons built quality is ok lighter than what i expected and lacks the premium feel to it screen resolution is not as good as other phone but it does the job mp camera is so out of date speakers could be a bit louder battery life does not last that long too much bloatwares that you do not need and some of them do not really work even after updates experience performance lag from time to time and no additional accessories such as sd card or earpieces are included,neutral
one side of camera didnt work,neutral
hi dear the phone is okay but the charger does not work otherwise than that problem i love it its cool,neutral
in general not a bad phone nice screen size and quality perhaps a tad heavy enough juice in the battery for one day use do not forget to charge regularly volume controls are not very responsive and opening and closing the phone to replaceinsert sim microsd andor battery is a nuisance as the plastic covers are difficult to userootingunlocking the phone is not too complicated apart from the challenge to enter hboot mode requiring powering on while holding the volumedown button the volume button is extremely unresponsive and i probably had to boot  times before being successful,neutral
decent case however upon taking phone out of case to clean the side piece now lose and moves but still works just really annoying,neutral
i think it was mildly used there were chinese apps installed on it a chinese user logged on and the plastic on it was slightly pulled offbut it was in a good condition and nothing is wrong with it so far,neutral

worked fine until a few months in with its first update battery is very easily drained and dues but last long half day at best when using any app restarts randomly and locks up randomly most apps close down randomly due to phones inability to run them well phone cannot run certain apps due to not being compatiblerecognized the longer i have owned it the worse the signal of the phone has gotten i cannot longer even get signal to make calls in my own home  of the time phone is very durable and quality of screen and camera pictures is great os system is fantastic i was impressed at first but i no longer enjoy this phone nor would i recommend it even with the larger memory and an internal sd memory card added i can not have more than  apps total installed or the phone begins to fail not worth what i paid in the long run,neutral

i owned this phone and although many people praise it it gave me a lot of grief it is far from perfect as others put it here it may have to do with amazon maybe and i am reflecting what i was told by nokia that they are not authorized to sell nokia products so they may be selling bad batches or refurbished productsif the phone i had owned is the real deal then take praises hereto with a grain of salt there are many flaws to the phone starting in the bluetooth pairing drove me nuts to gps which takes forever to sync and get you your positionbattery life time the biggest exaggeration what is stated in the spec is not even close to reality but every manufacturer is overstating this parameter because they know it has  it is hard to testcamera even with its stated m pixels quality is typical to sony bad i have a canon mp which has a far better picture quality no comparisonalthough it has gb loading songs which is a cumbersome task on its own will eat up a lot of juice couple that with gps maps and photos you would want to take and save you quickly run out of memoryso i think buying a different model with microsdhc is a better optionadditionally the phone tend to get sluggish takes some time to respond to a menu item taking photo editing music etcthere are some good features to it in call making contacts sms etc the classic phone featuresmy conclusion it is not worth the price think about what you expect from this phone and consider other realistic optionsi give it  stars as after all it is a phone that serves some purpose,neutral

i recently answered a question on whether the phone i bought was a clone or prefab it is not a nokia android clone of the windows os if it is a prefab i do not know as i stated in the response i thought nokia manufactured their phones in sweden not in hong kong probably assembled in china and distributed to the international market out of hong kong the phone was preconfigured for the hong kong market though it was in hong kong english it was easy enough to reset the phone without losing the app bundle it came with apps were enough for videomusic camera a driving navigator a walking map public transit some nokia proprietary apps that work well like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about  pictures the mobile office suite excel power point and word with office  to sync with your other ms office software i had to install a third party file manager app to access files on my sd card  gigs onboard mem is ok though if you want to save maps directly to the onboard mem memory be eaten up fast i loaded about  apps and have  gigs left i mentioned that maps because even though i asked the maps to load to the sd card they did not i was happy they did not because transferring the sd card from my phone to my tablet corrupted the data i doubt it was an issue with the phone however i was overseas and needed the maps and was thankful that they were on the phones memory the phone arrived about a week before the no later than date which was about  weeks i am rating this particular purchase at three stars for  reasons first the phone has a black back case and not red as requested sounds trivial but i wonder what else was not as advertised for example at the vendor you will get the latest os with the latest bundle i got windows  where at the vendor the phone was loaded with windows  maybe not a big deal until i actually ask to upgrade the os second the phone runs hot when browsing the internet and also using gps actively gps when in flight mode so i wonder about the cpu it is a  dual core but so is my tablet that does not run hot significantly hot i wonder if the phone is a prefab or if the chip is overclocked inferior chip running faster than advised to save on money third the initial price was attractive at about  but after paying  to ship to an fpo ae the savings of purchasing online did not really outweigh the peace of mind of purchasing the same phone at a local vendor where i can walk over and have it serviced or returned immediately if necessary i would have paid  more at the local vendor the battery life is decent lasting a whole day with some web browsing watching around hrs of video using the gps and a few short phone calls when i did notice the phone getting hot it did consume more battery life that usual i was slightly worried that the g standard here in italy would not be compatible with the frequency published but it works great sometimes a webpage will hang other times pages will pop right up the webpages hanging are starting to get annoying the windows interface for me is a breath of fresh air compared the android oss that i use on my samsung tablets i find the interface to be simpler and quicker for that matter,neutral
if your looking for a good smart phone with nice features and for half the price go for it the best feature is the dual sim slots also it has a nice  mp camera and big screen the only reason i gave it  stars and it has  it is not amazon it has  it is blu is that the wifi antenna is very weak and secondly blu came up lately with so many different updated models that made my phone looks oldi wish if i can return it and get the new one,neutral

this is one of the best budget smart phones i could find for tmobile currently i have a  year contract with tmobile and it is not prepaid i had bought a used htc g but it bricked after  year of use since i purchased the htc g used and it was not covered with warranty i was left to find a smart phone to use when i went to a tmobile store buying a smart phone from the kiosk would cost  and up the current flagship smartphone for tmobile is the htc one s and has a list price of  even with the offer to split the payment over several months the idea of spending that much for a smart phone that would be obsolete in a few years bothered me at almost half the price of what was being offered at tmobiles kiosk i found this phonei quickly discovered there are many bargain android smart phones that are unlocked can be used on multiple carriers if you are in the market to purchase a phone and already have a plan be sure to check that the bandwidth frequencies are compatible some of the g and g phones will work fine with att and not with tmobile only edge i found while searching the budget android phones screen size varies greatly some of the cheaper phones around  seemed to have a smaller screen given it is the primary input i knew that typing text messages and emails on a tiny screen would be irritating unless it had a physical keyboard or large enough screenthe samsung exhibit ii is now a little dated but comes with gingerbread and a bunch of unnecessary apps that cannot be uninstalled unless you root the phone rooting the phone voids the warranty and is the only reason why i have not done so already the response to input on the phone is fairly snappy and runs smoothly even though the ram is a little small the screen quality is surprisingly good and sharp call quality is decent i was even able to make a video call with the phone and had no issue with it the battery life with this phone has been typical of android phones that i have used lasting about a day with moderate use before needing to be recharged tmobiles g network is very fast where i live but is throttled after a certain amount of data has been used at this price range i think it is an excellent valuethe reason i have given this product an only average rating is that text messaging would not work for a week i went through all the typical troubleshooting methods and reset to factory default twice contacted samsung and tmobile customer support to get text messages to send samsung was very unhelpful and stated that issues with text messaging are an issue with the phone service provider tmobile initially stated that it was samsungs fault for not updating the drivers when going through the tmobiles forums it became clear that i am not the only one with this issue for a while the only way to send text messages was to disable the g and switch to edge this bothered me a lot as it became very annoying to switch every time i wanted to send a text message i was originally going to return this phone but decided to call tmobile one more time the tech at tmobile was able to fix the issue and stated that there was an error on their end and i am now able to send text messages ive now had this phone for over a month and have not had any other issueson a related note the customer service at amazon was stellar i had called them stating my frustration with the product and how it was not operating as advertised the csr was very friendly and answered all my questions regarding amazons return policy i am continually impressed by the competitive prices and customer service from amazon,neutral

ive had this phone two weeks now and while i mostly love it over my  year old galaxy s that was never going to see marshmallow it is not without its quirks i really wanted to give it  stars but since amazon only allows whole starsmy phone suffers from the ghost touch issue while charging it has happened on at least  occasions i have also had the fingerprint scanner refuse to register my attempts to unlock the phone this has happened probably a dozen times so far both problems seem to go away by using the power button to either lock and unlock the phone in the first case or wake the phone up in the secondi have also seen two problems that have happened once each and both were only fixed by powering the phone completely off and back on again first the phone stopped thinking it had a sim card in it even though it had been working fine for days second the battery started draining much faster than usual and the various screens seemed to show the gps was on and being used and eating up battery even though location and related settings were all turned off the list of apps showing battery usage seemed corrupted at this point as whatever was in the number three spot on the list would always get credit for the gps usagethe phone is nice beyond all of that lots of storage sd card if i need more lots of ram speed is good camera is good battery life is two days or more not counting phantom gps issue and in theory the manufacturer says it will get nougat and o when it comes outim willing to live with the problems that just need a quick unlock via power button the second batch of problems i mentioned are more irritating butif they end up being oneoffs or only happen once every few months or less then im fine there toowish it had a user replaceable battery like my s but the price point makes it a little easier to swallow needing a new phone in two years when the battery will not hold a chargethat has  that is probably enough random thoughts for now ,neutral

as someone who just wants a good small phone for making phone calls i found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone i could find the phone i replaced was a bar phone the size of a chicklets box every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flipphone garbageso i chose this phone entirely for its size not because it has  it is a smart phone keyboard way too small to type on and i was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth i do recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls but do not get your hopes uphaving said that you get what you pay for the pictures provided by the manufacturer are very misleading showing a standard android launcher screen when in fact this phone has a cheap custom ux that tries and fails to look like ios for no discernible reason this custom ui does not use android standards  for example  there is no apps tray and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not  it has a recent apps button but it has  it is inexplicably used for settings instead  recent apps is instead found only by holding down the home button the paltry user guide has no instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom ui so you are completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach recent apps so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens tap and hold on empty spot of launcher instead of using the perfectly fine android contacts app there has  there is a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired you cannot edit or delete contacts stored on your sim card but you can add new sim contacts  you shall  you will have to download sim contacts by penumbraapps from play store  the maximum volume on the handset is not loud enough the maximum volume on the speakerphone really really is not loud enough you cannot change lock screen background to pic  you are stuck with what they give you because of screen size keyboard is nearly impossible to type on  download touchpal which is a the best keyboard for android anyway b allows you to resize it i can type on this one status bar shows mobile  wifi signal strength but does not show bluetooth status again silly custom ui  however there is a power control widget you can put on the home screen for that the battery monitor is wildly inaccurate if you keep your phone numbers on your sim the direct dial widget thinks every phone number is a mobile phone and you cannot change it the accelerometer is sketchy  when pulling phone down from face during call screen comes on only about th of the time  worse power button does not start up the screen during calls about  of the time eitherif anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore i probably would not have even looked at this one but if you want a small phone with decent call quality you are pretty much stuck with this,neutral
if you like gadgets its super coolif you are looking for an actual cellphone with smartphone quality this is not for youthe sound quality on this cellphone watch is better than some others like the ultraslim gsm gdit is more user friendly than some others as wellif you have larger fingers this is one of the better cellphone watchs out there as the buttons are largerbattery life surprised me on this one ive been using the same battery for the last  days and have not had to charge it yetreally need to save your contacts to your sim card before switching over to this watch as saving contacts can be tediouswrist band is softflexible which is nice in comparison to other watches of this type i have a very small wrist and this band had notches that fit to size and the face was not too large for me,neutral

this phone is pretty decent but as one other reviewer said the screen dims after about  seconds automatically it does not shut off just dims when you are reading or doing things it is really annoying i find myself having to touch the screen somewhere to get the screen to come back up to full brightness and then i sometimes hit an icon and it launches something that i did not want as far as i can tell there is no way to change this and so far no apps i have downloaded have been able to correct it if this cannot be fixed i will probably return it i have an email in to bluproducts to see if they have a fix for it,neutral

at the beginning i was very disappointed since i bought this as a gift to my son and after a little bit more than a week the screen went black and after that it was deadthanks to amazon support i was able to get guidance to solve the problem i did as the manufacturer recommended and it starts working againit has frozen a couple of times since then but i am giving it the benefit of the doubt since the phone system is running some updates i hope can solve the problemi have used other phones like blackberry i phone and samsung and never had this kind of problems,neutral
i bought two of these phones because i wanted to surprise my friends who were going away on a trip and both of them needed new phones i looked at many different smart phones on here specifically with g lte which in itself narrows the selection this phone stood out to me the price seemed ok the specs sounded fine and the reviews were encouraging so i bought two i was excited about getting them and giving them away but the joy of the surprise did not last very long both phones have inaccurate sensors if i tap a letter in the top row it gives me language selection i need four sometimes five attempts to open an app because it does not respond to lighter touch it becomes extremely annoying when you type a message and it frequently inserts a suggestion just because you typed the letter slightly upward even for a budget phone like this one i expected better adjustment i also could not like in my own phone which was the same price but seems a much better quality calibrate the sensor to have a more accurate typing experience there was no way to fix thisas i gave the two phones away the frustration was high as i felt i had made a bad choice i am returning at least one of them and have already ordered a phone of which i know that it worksthere is some good about these phones however the wifi is relatively fast and the phone itself is fast in opening apps for example the screen is very clear and almost looks like a retina screen very high quality the colors are vibrant this phone comes with a screen protector and a slim silicone case all of that is absolutely great and i like that the sellers do sell a product with thought behind it but all the good does not help if the one thing that makes a phone useable being able to type or press on a symbol is not working well,neutral
ive brought this because i was looking for a budget phone and this phone meets my needs the problem im having is the bluetooth goes out for a second when streaming music which is a bummer since im a music lover another thing is the volume is extremely low as others have said when using speaker or just talking on it this is the reason i gave it  stars,neutral

the phone arrived on time and it looks good at first glance my gripe the display is not that expected of a good samsung phone there are cheaper phones that have a better display while it has a  mp camera the screen resolution leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to picture quality the speaker is also not as loud as expected other than that it really is a solid phone,neutral
cosmetically it has  it is in good shape but the battery life is rather poor,neutral
actually i like the phone the instruction book you need a magnifying glass to read even with glasses the print is just very small i went online and printed the book from there there are no outlets that carry a case for the phone so i ordered from an amazon seller and found what they said was a blu cover for a dash jr it looked like it but it was not what it looked like back to the phone i am still learning it and am enjoying it carol,neutral

first i want to say i love this phone everything about it is amazing if i was you i would buy somewhere else when i first opened the box the phone looked like it was in great shape its when i first turned it on that i noticed that there was something wrong the screen had burnt in images and not just a little bit i mean bad i fear that i got a display model the screen had lifting issues were the screen is separating from the phone itself finally the s pen was busted the sensitivity wouldnt adjust and the tip was worn to nothing the sad part is this phone was supposed to be refurbished its a good thing im tech savvy or else i would have returned it i installed the new screen for cheap and got a new s pen for cheap i love this phone and recommend it to anyone interested in it i would just buy from someone else,neutral
i did not want to spend alot on a larger screened smart phone so this is what i decided to go with issues with this phone i find irritating are swiping the screen to unlock automatically opens the camera  no option to make it stop the auto fill of words while texting is beyond irritating when it makes up words you had no intention to use  unable to turn it off the phone vibrates when the person you call picks up and they can hear it  something else that has no option to turn off even with a very clean screen sometimes it has  it is unresponsive the pros of the phone are the screen size the graphics are decent battery life is adequate ability to add storage unlike the nexus phone i previously had sound is good do not expect symphony hall out of any phone ill probably replace this phone sooner rather than later,neutral

id be giving this four stars but well it has  it is not really blus fault but this phone does not run anything but windows so it has  it is not like it has  it is unfair to blame the phoneat any rate i bought this phone because of cortana very specifically i used cortana on a demo phone at a store and asked for directions to a non specific place cortana popped up a list read it out to me and let me select from the list by saying the first one the second one the closest one at that point cortana pulled up the gps and began navigationso i buy this phone cortana cannot listen all the time like on the demo phone i tried not the same model the demo phone was a lumia not a blu what has  what is more on windows  the navigation does not and cannot have voice navigation you have to buy a separate program for thatthe phone does upgrade very nicely to windows  on windows  cortana still cannot listen all the time on this phone which is more a fault of the older cpu being too power hungry to listen for hey cortana all the time windows  only automatically begins navigation when you ask cortana for a very specific destination it pops up a list but it does not read it out to you nor does it let you select with voicethe reason im focusing so much on this is because i ride a motorcycle and use the phone through the blue tooth in my helmet i prefer to be as hands free as possible the less i have to look at the screen the bettereventually i started trying to work for a courier company that uses an app similar to lyft or uber tried them too the courier apps for lyft uber postmates etc are not on windows uber has a windows phone app but only for their taxi app not their courier applack of app support on windows phones does not end there it happens to be pretty much across the board for example cicis pizza an all you can eat pizza buffet used to have punch cards for discounts however they moved to an app instead that app is only available on iphone and android which in turn has actually dramatically reduced my patronage at cicis sure that has  that is cicis fault but microsoft is doing nothing to encourage app developers to support their platformso now im looking at going back to android,neutral

lets face it the last few versions of the big name smart phones just added bells and whistles to get you to spend a ridonculous amount of money on basically old news this is a basic g smart phone for a good price coming from a samsung galaxy s it handles all my apps just as well the downside is it is a little big and i had  issues with the software update because it does not like to install from your previous back up versions so i had to start from scratch which really is not that hard but it took a minute to figure out because their customer service kinda blows too hence the  stars either way for the price it does all the things and if you do not need the shiniest newest thing to take your pulse and watch tv in high def because you actually have a life it has  it is a good phone,neutral
its quality is not comparable with iphone,neutral

i bought this phone in february th  and it was working fine and now its just blanking out when i try to take pictures and now its not charging,neutral
well i bought one for my  year old son and he loved it but it was so tiny for me or my wife but just perfect for my son it also is water proof so if they drop it in water or want to go to the pool it fine and my son takes it in the pool sometimesgreat for children and can pick any service provider you want and can change providers when every you want,neutral
great phone for home only but it is not an unlocked phone,neutral
its an iphone  and it was in very good condition well packaged and delivered on time but i ordered an unlocked phone and the one i got was not unlocked it cost me  more before i could actually use the phone,neutral

it seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves who break the phones box seal open the box and unlock the phones themselves note that samsung says do not accept if seal is broken hence technically most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new i bought a lot of samsung galaxy s edge phones from amazon and most not all had the seal brokenon the phone itself this is the best phone i have ever tried slick light balanced fantastic screen fast water proof and so on  its only caveat and an important one is the lack of removable battery samsung lost the removable batter starting with the s i like this phone much better than the edge the s edge has a bigger screen but the resolution is the same as with the s and its edges are highly annoying making one touch them by mistake constantly furthermore the edges edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case  not a problem with the regular sfinally the only difference between the gf single sim version and the gfd dual sim version is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card which is recognized by the devices os,neutral
pretty disappointed i like eveything about the phone but this one had the notorious yellow screen defect that i read about did not expect it to be so common battery life was soso as well and dropped to nearly  after about  hours of constant chatting and surfing on it,neutral
ive had this watch for a few days now it synced to my android just fine downloaded the app for phone with the qr code fit is comfortable i have small wrists and it is not so huge it bothers me do not notice it really all notifications work well when i get a notification it plays my phone ringtone so both this and my phone are babbling minions till i check it the sleep monitor works fine only tried that once so idk how true but for last night being as i did not sleep it said poor seems right the pedometer works well but is a little slow takes a few to catch up texts messages come threw fine and you can reply to them phone calls come threw but i have not been able to talk on it due to interference with something else in my home possibly other bluetooth devices interfering browser remote capture image viewer and audio player i cannot get to function ive sent an email to the company due to this not really having instructions there was some but did not have much info so overall this is a good starter watch for someone wanting to try a smart watch which is why i bought it it works ok for the price will add more on email reply from company,neutral
thanks,neutral
the back of the watch has a very fragile material it broke down after a couple of uses other than that it works fine,neutral
the phone works fine the problem is the screen had a text window burned into it it has  it is not immediately noticeable but with bright backgrounds it is i guess i cant complain too much since it was about  cheaper than most of the ones i looked at still im taking an extra start off because of it,neutral
bought it for the camera that they claimed to be so good was so disappointed poor quality camera as well as the charger is already shorting a little over  weeks,neutral
it is ok for what i needed it for i needed something where i could quickly and easily set an alarm several time a day this does the trick i is a little bully for my taste but i can live with that i have a fire phone and it does not recognize the software but since i did not get it for its smart watch function i am no to broke up about that eventually i will get around to pairing it to one of my old iphones so i can play with it,neutral
the battery sucks ever since i bought the phone the battery started to show some problems for example  if im charging the phone the battery takes hours to charge literally hours and when the phone is finally charged the battery drains out easily and it does not show the right percentage in which the battery actually islet us say the battery is at  it will show you that is at  or some random number other than that the phone it has  it is fine,neutral
not sure how i feel about this phone i usually get samsung brand and decided to give blu a whirl since my husband loves his all in all its set up really nice everything is simple to find and easily accessible it lags a little bit in apps but not much and not constantly the cameras are excellent that was my big draw to it so there has  there is a win but the storage is absolutely terrible ive never had an issue with storage on any phone before but i had to delete apps that came on it and about  photos from my sd card in order to operate it otherwise it has  it is a decent phone,neutral
i dropped it on the carpet a few weeks after getting it and it the screen cracked scratches on screen  not super noticeable but made it easier for the the screen to breakthe actual phone size is nice not too big not too small,neutral
the flashlight does not work which could really be useful at some times also when i tried activating the phone it shows up as being blue cell instead of green with my cellular service everything else works pretty well,neutral
the battery in this phone becomes loose very often and the phone has to be taken apart  then reinsert the battery very annoying apart from that it is a nice phone,neutral

this phone is good overall it lets you do every thing i would expect from a smartphone at a low price however you should remember this is an old phone and it has  it is not even supported anymore by sony ericsson it comes with the latest android version supported for this  what bothers me the most about that is that you need android  or more to be able to install apps in the microsd card and the internal storage is very limited in this phone in the specs ive seen it says it supports  gb microsd cards but im using it with a  gb class  card without a problemphysically the phone is compact and sturdy a friend of my even was thrown into a pool with this phone in his pocket and as soon as the phone dried it started working again another friend did not have such luck with his samsung sii two thing i do not like about the design is that you cannot remove the battery and the cap for the usb cable which gets impossible to remove,neutral
had to go with fixing it in just a year screen got to get replaced got for motherinlaw and you can imagin what might have happened when it needed fixing in such a short duration ,neutral
i recieved my order in a timely manner although i received the wrong gbi decided to keep it overall im pleased,neutral
i purchased this phone because i was looking for the dual simcapacity i was getting tired of carrying around two handsets one for personal and one for business att is my wireless provider and i took the three handsets to the store and they got the two sim cards installed and activated in the new handset pretty quicklyi had to install custom ring tones to distinguish the two lines because the visual cues are too subtle and i have not figured out how to change thatfor my personal line i was converting from iphone to android so i tried to follow instructions i found online to transfer my pictures contacts and text conversations from the iphone to the new device however somewhere in the process things quit working and i had to perform a factory reset following the factory reset at after about two weeks of moderate use i have not even finished acquiring all the apps i use it became slow and glitchy i have to restart the phone at least once a day i hope the ota lollipop update comes soon and fixes these problems after the earlier glitch i am reluctant to root the phone and perform the update manuallyafter several months of use i consider the phone call quality to be pretty terrible i do not know how much of that is attributable to the handset and the network but every conversation involves asking people to repeat themselves because of garbled interference from the networkdevice ive only used the device in the lower  states and it has  it is ability to detect signals is hit or miss sometimes one sim card will have no bars but the other will have four bars it has  it is the same provider for both sim cards so im inclined to say that is a handset issue rather than a network issue,neutral
the clip broke the first day was very cheap and stiff still have the case it has  it is okay i guess and also not the color on the pictureits a more lighter version,neutral
part of right side screen does not work other than that good phone,neutral
pretty phone and it works great however it freezes often it has  it is nice as a phone for a younger person like early teen the camera is fine the apps run well and calendar is great storage is another issue that was resolved easily by getting a sd card,neutral
the battery loses itso charge to quick but other than that it has  it is a great phone,neutral
the phone looks to be ok but the battery was bad and i have to get a new onenot real happy about that,neutral

i bought this phone for a backpacking trip i am going on in southeast asia at the end of december but i have to say im a bit disappointed this phone looks and feels great but the problem that i am having is i have had a couple of dropped calls over the last couple of days and sometimes it misses texts altogether this is a bit problematic for me because i run my business and am a relatively social person through my phone with this being said i will more than likely switch back to an iphone once i return from my backpacking trip would i buy the phone again eh ive only been using it for a couple of days so im not too sure just yet do i regret buying this phone not yet hopefully this thing is not a complete piece of junk but there is no telling this early in owning it ive read some other negative reviews and i am really hoping this phone does not start getting super buggyok so it has been around  months since i have gotten the phone and now it is not taking a charge unless i turn it off to charge it and even then the charging is happening in a relatively slow manner pretty crappy that this thing is not working the way it should be after so little time having it,neutral
nice phone great screen for watching movies  videos good camera but i do not get reception where i live  it is dual sim standby browsing the internet is good too,neutral
its web browsing speed is fast and can do almost anything well camera video camera shot fm radio musicexcept for one problem  it does not have the capability of running online games or game apps its internal memory is not enough do not consider this model if you are using it for gaming however it does seem to play a select few games from touchpal funtouchpalcom which contain basic games that are kid friendly such as find emoji youtube cannot not be used since the latest version of google play which is required in order to play youtube content is also not compatible with this phone,neutral
it is a good phone as general here is what bothers me the most the compass when using maps it keps teeling me that the compass need to be calibrated and asks me to wave the phone in an  shape to calibrate it it does not matter howlong you wave your phone it will keep ask you to calibrate it  do not know why with the main creen apps screen most of apps the screen does not rotate it rotates for just office net  some other minor apps the notification system is not helping at all and you able to put just  different types of notifications to the lock screen  and when you unlock your screen you have to search for them by opening each app why there is no some top bar that contains all the notifications just as android i do not know how to upgrate my phone to windows  and afterlogging to nokia websit i just do not understand what is the business of my carrier company to do with upgrading the os it suppose to be somthing related to the phone itself not the mobile carrieri just listed what bothers me but there is many things i liked about this phone good deal but still need alot of progress,neutral

phone is okay at best physically the phone is nice and small and looks great but the functionality of the phone is poor options are very minimal it would be unfair to say phone absolutely sucks but considering price of phone cannot expect too much out of it i probably would never purchase another blu phone this model is fine but i have not had the greatest experience with other blu phones you truly get what you pay for,neutral

i am a big nokia fan and really liked my  and  so i was quite looking forward to playing with the n this is a exquisite piece of hardware the feel of the device is the nicest of any phone i have owned but the software is really showing its age even compared to newer cheaper nokia phonesnokia really are asleep at the wheel the  shows they can do reasonable job of making a touch phone using s but they have let their s flagship lag far behind other s phones that are less than half the price i gave both the  navigation edition and the  xpressmusic  stars based on the great usability and incredible value but the wonderful n hardware is let down by old softwaregood wonderful hardware excellent call quality very extensive feature set very nice screen in sunlight white color looks great nice keyboard except space bar gb internal storagebad home screen lacks scrolling contacts of  inconsistent touch menu some double some single tap very small space bar mediocre browser weak fm transmitter not powerful enough for car use ovi maps lack search you need to have google maps installed too no inline spell checkdo not even waste your time comparing this phone to true smartphones like nexusone droid or iphone gs its just not in that league software wise only price wise when you see what google and apple have done so early in the smartphone game it really is a shame for nokia such great hardware let down by such bad software and before you say n i had one and returned it maemo shows promise but is far from ready for primetime use and the hardware is a brickif you have lots of money already like nokia s phones and have never used an iphone or droid you should love this phone everyone else steer clear of it looks at the  or  if you wanna go nokia,neutral

the phone arrived on time and it looks good at first glance my gripe the display is not that expected of a good samsung phone there are cheaper phones that have a better display while it has a  mp camera the screen resolution leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to picture quality the speaker is also not as loud as expected other than that it really is a solid phone,neutral

well as a long time die hard nokia fan currently own a nokia ni was looking for a pone that would me to experience android but did not want an expensive flagship pone but neither wanted a low end one this pone fits that description i have used a galaxy ace and found it lacking some stuff i really wanted front facing camera decent rear camera and onboard storageand i realized then that i do not like touchwiz ui so samsung is out of the questionthis pone feels very good in the hand has the right size as most pones nowadays are over  inches in size and to me that has  that is just too big even though i have big handsthe downside for me is that the accessories are way too expensive for this pone and it does not came with a screen protector or a headseti am still stumbling on some of it has  it is features and on android as a whole as i am just learning the howtos of androidi am still looking for a substitute to my two years old n but untill i can find a pone with the same or better battery life  days with wifi on  hours and a better camera and a matching signal coverage and call quality the n is staying with meoverall i am lovind thei pone so far it just scared me a bit one time when after playing with the settings the screen would not turn on when the charger was unplugged i could hear the pone unlocking click but could not see nothing on the screen after reconnecting the charger the screen came back on so i increased the screen brightness a bit and the issue went away same thing happenned to me once with an asus netbooknice little pone really recommended for anyone who does not want a high end android but a good mid range one ohh and it comes with ics out of the box unlike the galaxy ace and i dot think it will ever be updated to icsupdate jan  minus  starts as the phone is now going to a repair shopit has developped a really annoying feature where if the phone is charged using the supplied charger it would get hot and after the screen turns off it will not come back on after the charge is completed the phone will continue to work as i will hear it unlock receive calls and notifications also but i cannot see a thing as the screen is completely blackit would normally wake up randomly after a couple minutes or hours and continue to work fine untill the next chargei then avoided charging it with the supplied charger and used the computer instead as when i did so it would not get hot and all will work fine after the charge is completedwell  days ago i charged the phone with the computer and the screen turned off as it normally does after the charge was completed it worked fine so i went outside when i tried to use the phone the screen would not come back on i can hear the phone doing the click when i unlock it i can receive calls but the screen is completely black days now and the screen is still pitch black so the phone is going to a repair shop so they can determine what is the problem with itas i am no longer in the us i cannot return it as the fee is very high to ship a package to the us and back so it has  it is going to have to go to a local repair shopi was so happy with the phone untill thisi must have got a lemmon,neutral

so i love the form factor and the idea of having near full functionality in a phone this size there are some serious issues with usability on this phone though the screen has poor touch sensitivity near the corners browser app displaces too much of the page with bars to be usable the battery indicator has no bearing on how much battery life you actually have the external buttons protrude too much and are sensitive thought pocket dialing was thing of the past on a positive note it does have better battery life than expected fun toy but it just does not work for me,neutral

maybe i missed it somewhere but this phone is apparently not compatible with verizon wireless service here in the states attempted to activate it here after initial setup but it was not recognized by the network i then contacted customer support for verizon who were very helpful but were not able to even identify this phone let alone activate it for use i will now be mailing it back and am awaiting the seller to call me back about this issueupdate after further research i discovered this phone does not work with cmda which is what verizon uses unfortunately this was not listed on the product description on the amazon site not the phones fault the phone itself seemed very quick responsive and intuitive would have liked to actually have been able to use it,neutral
i would not buy this phone again it has  it is slow and has issued locking up when i take pictures most of the time they are ruined it shall  it will be cut off with gray or green ive lost a lot of good pictures i can even check the picture after i take it to make sure it saved ok and come back to it later and it will be pixalated and cut off i cant wait to get a different phone i would not advise buying it,neutral

nowadays it has  it is hard to find a g feature phone that has  that is not touchscreen i prefer a nontouchscreen ui unless i am getting an iphoneandroidmicrosoft phone whose touchscreens are far superior since im not prepared to pay for an expensive data plan i got the zte z the only thing i can say about it is that it all its functions work except for the att appcenter which was recently discontinued the buttons are tactile that i can feel them without having to look at them menus are easily customizable lastly the phone does not accidentally pocket dial my boss on a saturday night while im out at the barthe reason why only  stars is because  you are somewhat limited in customizing the menu i would like to add certain submenus to my custom menu but it will not let me  music sound quality is simply poor overall there are equalizer presets to help with this but it still does not sound that great  bluetooth audio is just awful with my old phone i could connect to my car stereos bt to listen to my music the bt audio quality of this phone is so bad that it makes am radio appear better i believe this is due to poorly written software bt audio streaming should work as if you were running a lineout to your stereo instead streaming appears to function the same way as you would connect earphones the phone lets you adjust the volume  program the eq during bt streaming bt is not supposed to work this wayconclusion if you do not intend to use bluetooth or listen to your music at all on this phone then you will be happy with it if you do want to listen to music then get a different phone,neutral

this was my first time ordering from amazon i ordered this samsung s from amazon because i wanted white and could not find it in any stores i specifically wanted the s because it has  it is the lightest weight lighter than the s and the iphone s the phone is nice looking and stylish and i love the pearl white color but im a bit confused that the back of my phone only says samsung but does not display s like the other samsung ss that are sold here in america the writing on the back is in another language not english so maybe it has  it is made different in other countries i have noticed the battery drains faster than my last samsung s mini that i had for  years and i have had the phone freeze up on me a couple of times and the screen turned black and locked up i called samsung customer service and they told me how to reset by pressing the down volume button and the button on the right side of the phone both at the same time for  seconds im hoping that does not happen very often and has me a bit nervous im past the time frame where i can return the phone now so i hope i will not have any major issues since i paid  and would like to have it for at least  more years other than that it has  it is a nice looking phone lightweight and does everything i want an android operating system to do,neutral
bought for someone else and no complain made so far,neutral
only reason i bought it was the camera but the camera freezes often in video mode i had to return it,neutral

the charger doesnt work,neutral
this phone is a good phone overall there is just one major problem when the phone runs out of power and shuts down then when you plug it in the device constantly tries to boot up but the phone does not have enough power to this is a major problem because i constantly drain the phone of power and this keeps on happening blu should really fix this problem and add a thing that when you plug the device in when it is dead it just charges and does not attempt to power on without you pressing the power button also this phone is not the best phone or brand for the money i am returning this device,neutral

i think i remember this had  stars when i bought it it had everything i wanted and nothing i did not need i have not been able to figure out how to activate predictive texting but on the phone i had before the last one i did not use predictive text either so it is not so bad but a mild inconvenience the buttons click which makes texting sound like im a cockroach eating a cracker but i figure that has  that is not a big deal eitherit is surprisingly lightweight and extremely sturdy for as light as it is it has grommets all over the place to seal every crevice from water leakage i have never really worried about water before with a phone but this one id be more worried about it getting flushed down the toilet than falling in as one of my past phones did it is slightly bigger than my samsung gravity  i have not been able to transfer pictures or games from my last phone but i do not have a mini sd card either it is unlocked and has  sim card slots and it constantly reminds me that the nd sim card slot is empty i do not need a nd phone number so i do not have two sim cards it comes with one game that is a puzzle game ive quite enjoyed i do not see any avenues to download other games to it which is kind of sad but i am still trying to figure the phone out it may be that a more tech savvy person could figure out how to do what i would like to be able to do but i cannot it is not quite the step up from my last phone that i was expecting but it is not too much of a step down plus the price is half of what i paid for my gravity  five years ago no need for a case handles talk and textso yeah  stars it has  it is okay not great or even all that good but not bad and not too inconvenient best of all not expensive so  stars it is,neutral
its ok but the bluetooth sucks works for calling in car but constantly drops when playing music worst bluetooth ever everything else on phone works,neutral

i ordered what was supposed to be a new blackberry bold  the first one they sent was clearly used and not working well the second one may or may not be new but it was made for vodaphone in denmark it works sort of ok on tmobile i told seller it would be connected to t mobile but the software is some nonauthorized version that bb does not support and cannot upgrade the result is some funky outages and an inability to fully synch email calendar and contacts so it works as a phone with some aps but not as fully as it would if had been made for t mobile or att buyer beware of these cell phone suppliers,neutral
great phone is every aspect except for the phone itself talking reveals a defect in the phones design the other party can annoyingly hear themselves when they are talking i also tried to disable the noise cancellation microphone and it did not change anything i returned this phone because the phone in next to non functional,neutral
i bought this nokia phone because i had aonther one but this one must have been defective the battery does not pop out so even with tools could not work that out so i returned the phone it was impossible to get the battery out to change sim cards i mainly buy unlocked cell phones not only to use in the usa but outside the country so the battery has to be easy to remove to reach the sim card and change it sometimes i have to do it between planes other than that the phone was nice and the seller nice to deal with,neutral
cheap,neutral
is a good basic no frills phone i bought it to use in copenhagen paired with a jt international sim card could not get any cell towers so it was basically useless jt refunded my money and asked what phone i used the jury is still out on why i could not use it but for the price it was worth a try the primary thing i did not like about the phone was that it went in to lock mode every  seconds not a big hassle but it was a botherpaper came with the phone pointing me to a website for a manual in english only way to charge was via usb but i took a usb port to connect to my downconverter because of the voltage and prong difference phone was easy to set up and worked right away here in the us,neutral
at least this is a samsung phone but it did not come with a manual the flip top is lose so i believe it was used and it was not suppose to be at least i just made a bad judgement on buying this one as well my other phone had nothing with it for these phones to be new as i thought we did not receive any kind of manuals at all i wish i could do it all over again i am not happy with these phones will not buy againon amazon anyway will go to a store so i can see what i get,neutral
i bought the phone it looks great no scratches nothing it was a used phone the only problem was the batterie dies in about an hour and sometimes does not even turn back on it takes about  minutes i tried contacting amazon and they told me to check with apple but apple did not do anything,neutral
i ordered two of these lg env vx cause i loved this phone and i wanted to change my plan to basic phones they are great but one came with the wrong software and the other doesnt have the proper updated software it needs so i cant put music on it so that is a big disappointment especially when you do not have transportation to a verizon store to get it updated probably,neutral
purchased this in november we tried to get service with a tmobile sim card and the phone started rebooting every few minutes after reading reviews and seeing that this was a common problem with tmobile we decided to try cricketatt immediately upon installing the new sim card the rebooting problems started up again and the phone indicated that it was receiving service even thought we verified service after contacting blu customer service and doing a hard reset without any results we read a threestar review here on amazon where the user turned off the g and found that the phone worked so we tried the same thing and it seemed to resolve the problemto make this change the sim card has to be in go to settings  celluar  sim  sim  or  settings sometimes that menu did not appear do not know why so it took several tries we changed the options from g to g thankfully we are just using the phone for talktext so the g did not matter to us at all hope this helps someone else,neutral

decent phone with a large keyboard and good camera bought this to try and avoid having to pay for data on verizon wireless yet they still consider this to be a smart phone still used it for about a year and then it quickly began to run down on me slowly the touch screen started to become unresponsive without having dropped it in water or on anything else eventually all function of the touchscreen was lost but there are ways to get around it using the key board overall i was very satisfied with the phone for the first year that i had purchased it but soon after it began to be the source of many headaches,neutral
bought  refurbs for my wife and i to use on tmobile the phones themselves were fine but note that the sghi is designed for att which uses slightly different frequencies for their g networks this network issue led to disappointing g performance on tmobile something i wish id known before i bought and then returned the phones i would not recommend for use on tmobile but im sure they would be great for use on att,neutral

i have had the phone for a few months now it does not have compatible bluetooth which is very disappointing it was very quick to respond initially but now it has a slow reaction time and i can type my messages faster than it can process it it will shut off on its own at random times and reset there are times i cannot call out or receive texts no it has  it is not my provider as other phones in the house work fineon the positive side the graphics are great i love the quality of pictures it takes i work through straighttalk and set it up with ease,neutral

i bought this phone about a year ago and was initially very happy since the most recent update however it is slow and at times will not read my sim card as in ill be in the middle of a conversation and the call drops i look at my screen and it says no sim card installed the touch screen has also gotten buggy sometimes you have to beat it half to death to get it to engage other times it calls people when something inside my purse first turns it on and then brushes against the screen bizarrehaving said all of this i am on tmobile so some of these issues may be related to the recent removal of band  compatibility i definitely notice a huge drop in the call quality since the most recent update to the point that i want to throttle the thing out the window even with a headset i have tried  different ones people on the other end complain that they cannot hear meas to the screen being fragile that has not been my experience i have dropped the phone many many times often onto a concrete floor and it has not broken and i have not noticed any scratching on the screen i do not have any kind of case on it and it swims around in my purse unprotected so there has  there is thati think this is probably a really good phone for the money  if you are not on tmobile i really enjoyed it initially and felt a little smug that i had gotten such a great phone for such a low price i am buying something else though because ive lost patience with the call quality and other strange bugginess since the update,neutral
good were received on time and i am happy with my order also the correct good was received and is very well serving its purpose,neutral
the phone is great for the money only  problems the first is the bluetooth gets confused when there is more than one available paired device sometimes and the connection cuts in and out i have found no solution other than unpairing the device i do not want to use at the time the second problem and the reason i am taking away  stars is the phone pocket dials all the time at least  times a day the phone calls a random person when i pick the phone up strangest thing ive ever seen and i have no idea why it does it  simple problems that are extremely annoying it would be  stars for the price otherwise by the way reception is  bars better than the note  on att,neutral

i wanted to buy a phone with keyboard and bb classic was too low spec for me so i really had no other option but to buy this phonelooks wise its one of the best out there deserves full  stars build quality is good too specs are decent even at its launch price and has all the features needed except a finger print scannerthe camera is ok not very bad but not the bests either maybe i do not like the camera too much because i have always used nokias before and their cameras impossible to match however this slight shortcoming is more than made up by the beautiful and bright touchscreeni wanted to give it  stars if only because of its keyboard and the way it feels when you hold it but that has  that is where you run into a big problem it overheats like an oven and i am taking two stars off because of thati bought it in houston texas but i live on the other side of the world so there has  there is no way to exchange it and i use the cover i bought with it to prevent my fingers getting burned,neutral
unlocked quadband s smart watch phone support camera tf card micro sd card sim card bluetooth wrist smartwatchok let us start off with the good for the price point this watch feels and looks pretty high end the screen is super responsive and the ui is a bit tricky but after  minutes i was all good with it charge time was decent i went from  to full in under an hour battery life under normal use notifications bluetooth connection occasional time checking and steps was ok full day and it was down to about  so expect close to  days of usage from this watchthe bad this is android compatible not android wear so there is no way to get google apps on this watch you are stuck with whatever apps already come with the watch earpiece is the usb headphones so you cannot use any standard mm headset with the watch i have beats and it will not work with it even though the screen is responsive the apps are not really good and not friendly to usethis watch is an ok experiment but if you are looking for android wear device this is not it,neutral

pros i bought the phone for its great camera and audio features actual it was a gift given to me cons the battery does not seem to keep its charge i am not sure if it is because on a daily basis there are up to  to  apps always being automatically updated and unfortunately i cannot delete these unused apps from my phone also the mic on the phone cannot be seen at night the mic should also have its own key not combined with the period it has  it is annoying to hit ok everytime i enter my password it is an unnecessary key stroke i find the phone to be to big for my small hand,neutral

had problems at att when getting it hooked up u need to be more clear on what networks phones can be used for,neutral
it has  it is definitely all in one but it does not connect fully with an iphone c the bluetooth functions allow for answering calls from the watch but not making calls also it will not allow push notifications from emails messaeges or any apps the pedometer and sleep monitor also do not sync with phone but they still work,neutral
firstly the phone is very thin which is a plus for me the only problem is that the battery lasts just about one day after average use i was a bit disappointed with one aspect of the phone from the pictures i viewed on amazoncom it indicated that the phone was factory unlocked however when i received the phone it was branded tmobile other than that the phone is great it has an on board memory of gb as well as the keypad makes for easy typing,neutral
so i received the phone yesterday on a deal of the day special of  amazon had this past week and thought wow this is such a great deal until i realized it was only in gb i thought really they still make gb phones these days why well at least it has sd expansion and then realized it did not once again why not if your only providing gb why not include sd expansion makes no sense whatsoeverso i hesitated but thought well i can probably live with gb since i have cloud storage and a tablet with sd card so i pulled the trigger  is had to pass up i ordered the black leather edition and upon receiving it and holding it i was very pleased it has  it is beautiful to look at and hold and very well constructed as others have mentioned the smell and feel of leather is unsurpassed by any other phone i have used prior iphones samsungs lgs the arched back design also allows for a superior hold in the handso all is well i thought im loving it i turned it on and immediately went to the storage capacity and i was blown away only  gb of available storage what the hell how could this be there must be some kind of mistake this is ridiculous i was immediately prompted to update the software to lollipop which i did and after updating all firmware and the outdated kitkat it came installed with and adding whatsapp cbs sports and slacker i was left with a repulsive  gb of available storage i mean seriously this is a jokehow in the world does a gb device take up gb for the os perhaps gb maybe  but  and if so why the hell is not it advertised instead of gb it should be sold as gb of usable storage i would have never purchased itso yes the phone is pretty to look at and hold and yes the os is stock android which craps on everything else but the usable storage of the moto x is not reasonable and therefore i cannot recommend it especially if this is your go to phone and plan on having it for a while with more apps a few songs and constant app updates you will run out of storage in no time and your phone will begin to lagif moto is going to undercut the storage than at least provide an sd slot perhaps go for the gb or just get a nexus i mean really my lg optimus g e from  is also gb has a ton of att and lg bloatware and yet still has gb leftover of usable storage and includes sd expansion and that has  that is a  year old phone,neutral
it has  it is the cutest little phone you shall  you will ever seehold while it is possible to use it for literally everything a much larger smartphone can do it runs an old os and texting on the tiny keyboard is nearly impossible i was walking around running errands and i simply was not able to walk and use my phone at the same time i had to stop and type verrrrrry carefully to do anything from text to check the map im very sad to say i returned it after one week to be fair this may be in part because i went from using an iphone to this maybe a little to much change at once,neutral
its a very good cellphone i like itgood service,neutral

the watch is ok basic no frills you are getting what you pay for,neutral
not as good as the previous version maybe they shall  they will fix the software sometimes slow and clunky you have to reboot a lot the outer shell is not as durable as the previous version either still a good a product for the price and very versatile with sim cards the phone usually recognizes the carrier and sets the data settings for you automatically that has  that is a nice feature,neutral
so i first received my phone in february and all was fine except for missing addons memory card headphones manuals etcbut the seller stated that those items do not come with it if it is purchased usedwhile i did not agree with the notion i accepted it but now after two and a half months my phone no longer worksplease be careful when buying used itemsnow what do i dothe phone is a good purchase but did not last long enough to be enjoyed,neutral
pretty good phone experience definitely good value for the price the screen is fairly vibrant and responsive audio is good the accessories included good earphones and plastic case the one case you are ever going to have are nice the two sim card slots in the back are good for travelone major issue is how they partitioned the storage internal storage is only about  gb and that has  that is all the room you will have for apps and certain data though you can alleviate this issue with an external sd card the limitations of  gb are still rather annoying and have forced me to only have the pertinent apps and not install fun appsdefinitely recommended as a initial phone for kidsteens backup phone or temporary replacement but a higher end flagship phone may be otherwise more recommended because of its one flaw,neutral
i recently ordered this love the phone but the package was opened and there were no headphones at all like in the description when i want new i want to pay for new unopened unused all contents disappointing,neutral
my son wanted a watch so i researched all over amazons choices this watch seemed to be excellent it came in i did not even open it just gave it to my son excited he has  he is  and a tech junkie he took one look at it and tossed it aside he has  he is about  feet tall and a big guy so it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him he said the watch face itself is much too huge too thick too big for him to wear he did not like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it altogether and was not interested in it any further he left on the table beside him and did not give it a second look even though i advised him all it could do nope not even remotely interested because it was too big i tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him ive still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago im keeping it though hoping that one day it will be useful to me im thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes but i really cannot speak up on it i have not used it no one wants to wear such a thick faced watch so the technical features have not yet been experienced so if i do take the time to find someone to use it i will be sure to update you on that the three stars is only that no one wants to wear it,neutral
i had to buy the d model in order to make sure it will works in brazilsometimes the camera focus just stop working everything is blurred despite the camera app saying it has  it is ok os is version  so theoretically the previous camera bug is fixed restarting the device and tried other camera apps but the problems persists it can stay in this state for hours my hope is to be a software problempreviously ive owned a nexus s and a galaxy nexus and never had any problem with theseotherwise the device is good screen is big and have nice colors very fast battery life is par with my previous galaxy,neutral

it has  it is been  months since i bought the milestone recently it received it has  it is froyoandroid  upgrade the phone is heavier than your average phone and is more solidly built the screen has a nice resolution and is sufficiently responsive the processor though is not quite fast enough on many an occassion the milestone crashes when loading heavy apps like maps or latitude the sluggishness in general usage is easily visible especially when compared to the new and cheaper alternatives the camera works fine  takes ok pics and decent videos the bluetooth and wifi work as expected gps and agps works pretty well keyboard is useful but takes some getting used toto sum things up you are better off now buying a different phone you shall  you will get phones which performs better at a lower price or maybe you could get the newer milestones,neutral

things i liked the phone works i was able to send texts and make calls with an att sim card in it the sound is not fantastic but is loud and clear enough some features it has are  sim card slots an led flashlight on the top an fm radio and an alarm clock i like that entering symbols into text messages is easier than on my old samsung phone which is done here by pressing star then selecting it from a menu it has a standard micro usb port for charging which is clearly better than some proprietary connector that you might lose the charger for mine came with a replaceable  mah lithium ion battery that seems to hold charge well it has one external antenna jack under the back coverthings i did not like the phone feels cheap i hear loose plastic rubbing when i grip it and the keys make a lot of noise the back tends to fly off when the phone is dropped which can be a problem since the phone is barely large enough to hold comfortably i also do not like the small size of the number pad which could have been bigger if they moved the screen up a bit the software on the phone is also frustrating which takes too many steps to select a sim card or turn off sound effects and lacks some options i thought all phones had it will not let me change the wallpaper on the home screen from this gaudy purple flower and there was not anything about it in the manual there is no usb filesystem access or sd card slot so you can only copy your contacts to sim card memory there is no online support for it in the united states and mine came with a european charger that i needed to find an adapter for to change a sim card you need to take out the battery and it asks you to set the date again each timeoverall this is by no means a great phone but for thirteen dollars plus shipping i think it was worth it,neutral

at this time the phone works fine the cables were not a apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by itunes had to spend more money on a cable,neutral
the phone works but you have to expect it will suffer in comparison to other phones out today i got it mainly because i needed a basic phone option for family and the basic phones available at verizon are not much better than these and cost you a two year contract or a lot more moneythe main concern i have is that although it was advertised as brand new the phone came in generic packaginglike the packaging i receive when i get a refurbished phone from insurance additionally when i plug it in with the power cable and adapter it came with the phone displays a message this cable was not made for this phone it charges anyway though and when i reached out to the seller about this they just said this is common for this model so take it for what it has  it is worth,neutral
satisfied with my purchace,neutral
ive had the phone for about two weeks and so far it has not given me problems it has  it is been running pretty smooth i really like it so far but it has really bad front camera quality the back one is decent but not the front also it would make it much better to have more accessories available for this phone because there is rarely any and the screen protector is a bit costlyupdate after having it for a couple months ive noticed that the phone gets really hot whenever you use any app and it has started running much slower even though i still have a lot of memory free on it it has started freezing up and ive had to shut it down a couple times in order for it to unfreeze,neutral
the amazon ad stated this model was a gbyte version the phone i received was a gbyte i sent it back and asked for a  gbyte version i was sent exactly the same model i would have sent it back except the phone is worth what i paid you can change out the battery you can add a sd card the screen is great it takes great pics it is extremely light fair enough i guess i now have the moto x  i use the lg g as a backupnow the ad states this is an  gbyte model it only leaves about  gbytes after adroid and a few apps better get a sd card,neutral

mostly this phone has been great the battery life is superb and when you factor in the ultra power saving mode you can go forever my major complaint is significant though the gps signal stinks if you use your phone often for navigation you are no better off than printing directions off on mapquest via  the gps signal is constantly dropped and searching from all the searching ive done it is pretty universally accepted that this is a hardware problem and not a bug that can be fixed with an upgrade,neutral
it has  it is not as great as my old lumia two major problems im experiencing with this phone low battery life wifidata constantly dropsbatterythe blu studio  c hd has a  mah battery which i thought was a step up from my lumia s  mah battery big mistake when i begin my day with  charge i can just leave it on and do nothing and watch the percent drop in a matter of minutes if i leave if in my pocket with the screen locked and turn off wifi and data and all location services and have the phone running in power saver mode with the brightness all the way down i find that it loses  charge in about  minutes this is atrocious im scared to watch what happens when i actually use the phone when i do use it to the max with a few apps running and wifi on i watch it lose about  per  minutes yes the display is p but that should not be a problem the windows os must use little power or something because my lumia could last me at least one and half days only now after two years it has begun to lose charge faster but still can get a full day of use the lumia has a smaller display coming at  and a really low res of x but it has a smaller batter too yet it still lasts longer than the bluwifidataboth this phone and my old lumia  from about two years ago have up to wireless n and g hspa however the blu studio  c hd constantly drops from the network it says that it has  it is still connected to wifi and data but it does not update anything i do not get new hangoutfacebook messages and i cannot use the browser it only begins to work once i turn off wifi and then turn it back on and same with data im guessing this is an os problem and ill see if i can try it with a custom romif the charging port on my lumia was not broken i would not have switched to this phone im thinking of just getting the wireless charging shell for the lumia and a qi plate and then just using the blu only for the few android apps it offers that i need that i cannot get on windows phone,neutral

in general it has  it is a fairly nice watch and works with the bt notification and the mediatek smartdevice app the latter allows for very intricate configuration of app and system service notifications android only four main negative issues while the device is truly m rom and will take firmware updates found in the xda developers forum this hardware does not work properly with those firmware screen appears upside down with other issues this device implies you can set custom wallpaper but when a new image is set it never actually gets applied ive tried x and x sized images in both gif and jpg formats i may have even tried png the bluetooth utility does not have a search feature like my dz this means that if you will have a problem trying to connect bluetooth headphones or headset that rely on the smart device to initiate the pairing so i have not been able to pair my headphones that i used to workout with the pedometer does not seem as accurate as my dz and none of the android apps ive tried on my samsung avant seem to work with calculating the data from the watch into meaningful results calories etc but this has been the case with the dz as well i tried a number of apps on my single avant and tried reboot combinations of all sorts but could not get the apps to receive data even though the phone did connect to the watches successfully,neutral

i got this phone hoping the nokia brand would give me better reception in the office it has  it is mildly better than the last verizon phone i had i was disappointed compared to my last  nokia phones the sound quality on this phone lacksthe keyboard is great rarely hit the wrong key the twist feature is awesome autolocks the phone when you close it and displays your choice of screen saver with option to unlock and view messages ignore or silence but not answer incoming calls without opening the phonealso disappointing was the lack of memory allocation control you have a limited amount of text memory with no option to copy texts to microsd music player and speaker were fabulous but speaker quit the first time i dropped the phone with a hard case on ive dropped other nokias tons of times in water too without a case and they remained undamagedthe software is ok at best not very intuitive at all symbian was very intuitive even more than the iphone software in my opinion you definitely have to hunt through some menus to change options outside the norm eg ringtone etc and the graphical interface is klunky especially when it comes to texting which is a shame given how amazing the keyboard isall in all if i were a teenager and did not require much from my phone i would be very happy with this one it has  it is cute small unique has avatars adequate ring tones great screen and keyboard easy to text on,neutral

this is an excellent phone but it does have an issue i have purchased two  months ago with no issues purchased another recently and returned it due to an issue with the snowy white screenstatic which requires a soft reset after a few weeks decided to return for refund thinking it might be defective and ordered a replacement received the replacement and carried out all updates and white static screen happened again during first day of use i believe it may be software related rather than the phone itself if it were not for this issue i would have given the lumia  a perfect  if anyone knows how to resolve this issue i would definitely be interested in learning the resolution,neutral

i loved this phone untill the digitizer broke and it became a brick i will say it worked ok not great with tmobile here in puerto rico the battery wouldnt last as advertised probably because it was looking for signal all the time people said it would bend and that it would get too hot personally i didnt experience this it remained snappy for as long as it worked can confirm the amount of megapixel doesnt make a big difference the pictures looked liked that of any other flagship phone you have to use a case with this one its super slippery my headphone broke after a few months and would only play music from a precise angle the display looked very beautiful,neutral

would have been perfect if it had worked i did not realize when i heard people talking about g going away that it had to do with ability to make and receive calls i thought g referred to data i was wrong the sim card from ting i used was working just fine in two other phones but could not work in this after much back and forth with technical support who conferred with their parent network of t mobile the phone is not g therefore towers that carry more than  connectivity are limited even with  bars the phone could not make or receive calls pop sim in another phone and it was fine sorry too because it was the perfect size and features for my  year old,neutral

i want badly to give this phone a better review however after using the z and then the z this phone is a bit of a let down sony decided to use a less expensive processor resulting in a much lower priced phone this is the great news and the processor seems to be very effective the bad news is that sony for some reason changed some of the things which made me rave about their phones in the past the first thing they changed is there is no longer a magnetic charging option also the usb port is not covered making this phone nonwaterproof without the magnetic charging port the usb port has to be used if sony had made this phone wireless charging compatible the removal of the magnetic port would not be an issue why are so many phones wireless charging capable but sony cannot get onboard with this the fact that it is rapid charging capable is a plus however i had to purchase a rapid charger separately sony also removed the capability to connect to a tv via hdmimhl the only way to connect and play media on a tv is via wireless means dnla bluetooth therefore if the tv is not uptodate with those technologies you are out of luck bad move sony bad move the camera so far does seem to have been upgraded i was never impressed with the camera on both my z or z what i am curious is if i will still have to use my microphone stm at concerts in order for the sound to not be garbled,neutral

i really want to love this phone but after using it for a little while i just cannot i did not even come here to review the phone it has  it is perfectly fine where its at great battery life for its price what i really want to know is what has  what is up with blu support no drivers come on my computer cannot even recognize the thing the average person would find it impossible to get this phone to work with a computer let alone root it the blu community should not have to troubleshoot the phone they have got people practically begging for answers on the public google plus page that the community itself created instead of the actual company support helping you have average consumers that have bought the phonegone through the same issues and giving you advice on what you shouldshouldnt do it has  it is ridiculous then there has  there is the official blu dev site but that has  that is run by a single person that hardly can because he has  he is in college a single person out of all the people working there only one took money out of their own pocket to get a dev site going that only lists a handful of devices other than that again it has  it is a great choice if you are on a budget just do not expect dev support until a later time,neutral

i had seven months will damage the screen i had to stop using,neutral
having issues with overheating battery just got it yesterday hopefully this will not persist call quality was blah but i did change a setting to fix that,neutral
it has  it is a good little phone for that price the camera does not take very clear photos,neutral
seems like a nice device but the sound quality is bad worse than the  year old phone i replaced unless i talk at the tiny mic opening at the bottom of the phone the people at the other end of the call cannot understand what i am saying the clear case may partly cause this problem  or not i put a tracfone gsm sim card in  that was a mess but eventually got straightened out  i hope do not know if i will be able to access the web via att  so far i have only used my wifi which works perfectly im obviously not a techie so using this unlocked phone was a challenge i hope i can figure out the sound quality issue  since i bought it to use it primarily as a phone,neutral
the screen is very good and so are the speakers the battery life is good as well the phones weakest points are build quality and performance it became frustrafing to use the phone itself looks great but the speaker and screen had some movement it seemed separated,neutral
not a great smartphone but for the price it has  it is awesome,neutral
phone is great as seller promised was in perfect condition  stard because i attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied att will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract,neutral
just got this yesterday it seems like a great phone i transfered my contacts and downloaded my favorite apps however today i put a gb card and it would not read it so i put a  and  and they would not read as well so i think that may be defected i have to contact amazon,neutral
when i purchased my lenovo a it was for its large screen size the ability to be used on the straight talk phone service and the megapixel count for the camera on this device i still enjoy all of those things the fact that it has removable battery with longevity past what i expected but there is something deeply dissatisfying about some apps from the play store not working on this phone,neutral

the phone itself is overall great battery however not so much ordered phone fromy seller breed to discover the battery was defective and will have to get a new one battery has about  hours without use and dies around  or  other that this phone was in amazing condition and not even a scratch,neutral
good protection but takes away from the slickness and form of the iphone s makes it look like a toy cell phone,neutral
i got this as an inexpensive replacement phone for my galaxy s i do not need all the bells and whistles that new phones offer i just need a reliable phone that i can occasionally surf the internet on the go from use spotify to listen to my music and connect to my cars bluetooth for calls and music this does all of that however the most important feature of a phone to me is call quality the call quality is terrible it sounds incredibly tinny and i cannot understand the caller half the time this is only due to to the cheap quality speaker call quality over bluetooth is great,neutral
the battery last half the time as my other iphone and it came with a small water damage spot,neutral
not highly functional phone will not buy it anymore,neutral

took  hours to figure out this issue but i am stubborn and unwilling to pay the bucks for the latest model verizon does not have a simple activation process and i found it currently can not be done on web  needs older model sim chip it is the larger one must be activated through a trick the sales rep found a way to activate the sim via first activating it through a lg g phone at a sales office and then transferred the sim to the razor,neutral

update the more i use it the more i realize that the gps is horrendously awful and ridiculously slow to lock on it has  it is nearly useless as a location deviceanother really major annoyance you cannot segregate your text message ringtone from other notifications there is only a setting for default notification sound what this means is if you push email weather facebook etc to your notification bar you will get the same sound that you had  you would get with an incoming text every time so either no notifications or no ringtone for texts what terrible softwarei dropped this to  stars because this is truly a mediocre device overall im really glad i did not pay the full  asking price now the notification issue terrible gps and no cases makes this a bad choiceoriginal post while i ended up getting this  of them actually for  ill write this as if it had  it would been full price while shopping for phones for the kids i noticed the gold colored titan max units were  even though they were bigger than i was looking for i could not pass that up so i bought  i also just recently bought myself a new phone an honor x the new best  phone on the market i popped in my gosmart mobile sim and this posh phone actually seems to run fairly similar to my x other than the back of the case all plastic the phone seems quite solid i especially like the way the outer edge of the phone looksfeelsprosnice vibrant screenresponsiveit comes with a clear silicone phone case thankfully and preinstalled screen protectorcomes with ear buds cheap but still nice to get somecamera takes pretty good picturesgood solid feel in hand not especially large even for being plays games quite wellconscamera shutter speed seems especially slowthere are zero aftermarket cases available not the phones fault but clearly an issueit looks fairly cheap the back cover is the main problem it has  it is completely plain and just a solid slab of plastic the camera and flash back there are also cheap lookinggps is somewhat inaccurate but it maintains a solid signal works good enough for me in the sticksthis is an decent  phone i think it has  it is priced a little high as you can do better for just a few more dollars or get similar performance to this for less moto g etc  or less if you want a large phone the asus zen phone  and honor x are better units with more features and they only cost about  more granted they are only  screensi think  would be the sweet spot price for this phone but  is still a good value the biggest issue is no cases that alone will prevent this from ever becoming my daily driveri added a bunch of pics since there seem to be so few of this phone,neutral
i thought these were a hellaciously good deal so i got several of these for our family after using them for awhile the biggest complaint i have is that the phone randomly locks up multiple times a day it lags really bad after a few uses and god help you if you try to make back to back calls because it simply will not work it will not let you hang up find another number and immediately place a call you have to wait a minute literally and then if you are lucky it will work i have antivirus installed and know that the phone is clean it has  it is great with using apps and overall i like the phone it has  it is just a few quirks that irritate me and prevent me from giving it a better review it has  it is still not bad for the money i really am hard on phones  i use them constantly and work them nonstop internet calls texts etc im overall happy with it and you cannot beat the price,neutral
this phone works ok but now that i need a replacement screen for it that is a problem i search the manufacturers website as well as amazon and cannot find any replacement parts for this phone i would not advice anyone to purchase this phone or any other posh device,neutral
good were received on time and i am happy with my order also the correct good was received and is very well serving its purpose,neutral
it is what you get for this money it is only g capable this is my first apple phone and till now i am pretty satisfied with it,neutral
the phone seems to be alright but the case that was included in the package does not fit the phone it is too small and it has  it is construction is very cheap this is not a lg phone nor are the assesories made of the same quality but for the moneyam not  are not  is not  has not  have not bad i do wosh that someone would send me the right size case for the phone,neutral
for the price this watch is awesome i am looking to upgrade to a samsung gear soon so this was a starter watch to see what it is like to be able to check messages without having my phone in my hand you cannot set themes to this watch so if you are big on personalizing then this may not be the watch your looking formove along,neutral
enjoyed it is a very good handset with amazing features but could improve by incorporating metal parts like the iphone,neutral
first of all i hate when there are a bunch of great reviews from people who received the phone for free to give a review i wish amazon would not allow thisas for the phone  i want to start by saying that i do not need a super charged ultra special high functionality smartphone i had a samsung galaxy s and did not think it was worth the money since i do not really stream things and i just use it for calls texting pictures and emailsim not a techie but im also not nave about technology i knew i was getting a subpar phone for the good the camera is really amazing it put the camera on my samsung galaxy s to shame especially the front facing camera i loved the quality of these pictures fantastic beautiful clear detailed high quality pictures for a  phone i spent  on my galaxy s and it paled in comparison the size and weight of the phone was perfect very light very thin and fir very well in my hand i have shorter fingers and have a hard time with phones that are too wide this phone was perfect for my hands love the color options i ordered pink and it was super cute speed was fine not issues at all for what i was doing lots of the features that the s had dual sim card slots is a great optionthe bad states that you can use up to a  gb micro sd card and i put mine in however the phone could not read any of my files from the card i could not listen to my music pull up my ring tones or see my photos i searched and searched the blu websitesupport online and the manual on the phone that links to their website and there was no troubleshooting help listed i tried downloading different apps that might allow me to see the files and nothing i do not know if it was a defective phone or if the phone just does not read certain types of files but if that is the case this needs to be laid our very specifically for people when they are purchasing this was a deal breaker for me when i would talk on the phone via the handset attach the wired headset that comes with the phone and use the bluetooth headset that i have used for a while my calls all appeared to be clear and sound great but the people i was talking to said that i continued to intermittently fade out and sound blurry this is without moving around and in the same service area as i have been in before with no issues and have not had issues since i stopped using the phone so must be the phone when talking on the handset the screen goes crazy it does not black out you have to physically turn it off otherwise your call might be placed on hold hung up on or random apps might open this has not happened to me with other phones so it has  it is not like im a phone idioti really had high hopes for this phone as my low cost low expectation phone and the good almost outweighed the bad almost i am returning the phone because of the issues with quality of calls and the sd card issues too bad because it otherwise seemed like the perfect phone for me,neutral
this phone does most of what it is supposed to but there is at least one time each day when i can only get it to start up by removing the battery or doing that second thing with the vol  and on key if it were not for that i would be pretty happy with it battery could be better and it seems to hold a high charge for a long time and then drop precipitously keyboard seems to be set for typing below the letter,neutral
i did not receive a battery with my phone was disappointed because i had to purchase one to use the blackberry,neutral
my only problem with this phone is that it will not stay connected to my wifi,neutral
ordered phone  great shipping  would have been better if i could use it on my account like the description stated ,neutral
i really liked the keyboard and the larger screen but i did not like the extra weight or the dimensions of this phone i simply does not feel as nice to hold or easy to hold with ease as the n it is also much heavier than the n it would have been nice if nokia found a way to lighten up the phone maybe with carbon fiber or even polycarbonate composite aluminum is a thing of the past too heavy and easy to ding up the biggest disappointment is the firmwareos it simply was not ready for prime time or release it was too buggy and constantly required poweroff to reset i was unable to end calls or press to take calls since nokia chose to take the talk button away a very not smart move i also experienced frequent lock ups in any case it was more buggy than the n even though they both use symbian os who knows i wish it was better nokia support was not helpful too green and not knowledgeable enough to be useful i would look to the next generation nokia phones running symbian anna due out julyaugust timeframe,neutral
was just as described but i had to return it as i no longer needed it,neutral

the phone itself was perfect and arrived on time so no complaints there the one issue however is that the phone i received was intended for a european market  and thus the phones charger was for a europeanstyle electrical outlet the seller was nice enough to through in a cheap adapter so i theoretically could have used it but this seems like false advertising to me it should have been noted in the description that this was a european version of the galaxy s edge im returning this product and will buy the us version from another seller,neutral

after a day or so i was able to send texts but i was not receiving texts i was still getting emails though also i put a meditation thing on my phone and when i was listening to it the playback was accelerated i know it is not the fault of the mp because i listen to that recording on itunes and ipod without a problembelow is my review before the phone went on the fritzi love the pink i am moving from a curve  to this so i was coming from the stone age when i bought this the keys are spaced much farther apart than the  which helps a lot the phone is slim and light the sound quality is great i set my ringtones to some of my favorite songs and they sound so good sometimes i just start dancing and forget to answer the phone my only gripe is that the battery power is nowhere near what i used to get with the  however i actually think the  was just some sort of freak of nature because the battery life on that phone was absurdly long so the battery life on this phone may actually be great relative to other phones it does not come with a memory card so you should buy one of those there are very few ringtone options on this phone there is an auto flash on the phone and the picture quality is pretty goodthe seller breed was also kind enough to reach out to me after my purchase to see how everything was going and extend the offer that i may reach out to their team if i have any questions however i ordered the blackberry q from breed after this and the phone they sent was made for europe so it would not plug into usa sockets that was frustrating i sent back that phone and i ordered a q from another vendor,neutral

does not recognize any memory cards otherwise works very well,neutral
i thought i was buying a  gig but i got it only had  gig of memory,neutral
the phone hardware was perfect  but the software that came with it was an older version and because the phone is no longer supported by verizon i was unable to download updated software including the vz navigator which was a critical piece of what i wanted the phone to do i ended up using the new battery that came with it to replace the battery in my older phone of the same model with the software already updated and i now have my old phone working almost like new battery seems to lose charge just a little faster than it originally did i guess im going to have to find a currently supported phone that will work for me but im not there yet,neutral
pros dual sim and great colorcons poor quality camera and extremely large like too large to fit in any pocket every designed for a human beingi regret downgrading from my iphone  for this it serves it has  it is purpose of communication and yes the android system is more user friendly but the camera quality is what ruins the phone for me also for some reason some apps that require camera access do not have the same quality as when i use the camera independently,neutral
way better if you have a samsung iphone does not work to great all you can do is call on it also my camera was crooked,neutral

i purchased this phone when the price first dropped to  on black friday i figured this would be an upgrade to my damaged nexus  rather than repairing it the great part of this phone is that it had more ram drive space and a seemingly faster processor plus that fact that i could add an sd card and was waterproof was a bonusupon use i immediately noticed that the octacore processor would heat up the phone very easily to the point that it would be hot to touch i use this for everything from setting appointments sharing files across apps playing candy crush running with runkeeper and playing music using wazegoogle maps and posting on facebook it acts fine with using one app at a time but crashes overheats and slows down completely when multitasking this is very frustrating when im trying to make a call or quickly set up directions for navigationon the plus side i am happy that it is waterproof i went running last month and during the last quartermile i got stuck in a rain storm did not affect the device at allbeside the fact that it has more storage that is also expandable my nexus  with less cores and less memory easily outperforms this phone hopefully the zseries of this phone is much faster else i may have to get the more expensive samsung s series phones to solve my frustrations,neutral

purchased this as a used pone from the wdo seller so this may not aply to all of the vendors selling this phione when purchasing this phone be aware that although it says it will function on the att and tmobile networks because it supports gsm  in reality it is a verizon phone that has been unlocked voice calls work text messages worked after some configuration changes and internet access works although you will not get g or g service from tmobile visual voicemail will not function as the phone is hard coded to work with verizons implementation of that service in addition it is hard coded for verizon voicemail  had to reconfigure the voicemail number and the apn to get this phone working with tmobile also had to apply  bb os  patches to get it to work properly with any of our blutetooth ear pieces make sure you either know how to make the needed changes yourself or know some one who can do it for you the only way to make this a totally functional att or tmobile phone would be to root it and install a bb os image configured for those carriers,neutral

the phone is quite ok however the customer care at motorola was not so helpful unfortunately my phone display just crashed and i had to call up motorola to get a replacement even though they sent me a replacement the new phone had defects too causing it to reboot every few hoursi had to again call back motorola and had to go through a lot of explanation and really had to explain the customer agent for about  minutesin the end all my excitement for this phone died seeing the defective replacement phone and the kind of customer service i received for once i felt i am speaking to a machine as they were only repeating what they were to say even talking to an escalation manager did not help i have my doubts if i really spoke to a human on the other endjust waiting for the replacement phone to arrive so i can sell it to some one and move on from motorola,neutral

i loved the idea of having a smart watch ive been looking for one for a while and i was not willing to pay  for the samsung gear it did not come with any directions per say so you just have to wing it on operation use set up of course is touch screen it took me a little while to figure out that you can swipe through the main screens when you want to dial out the numbers are not  am not all that easy to push so you may find yourself having to redail the numbers a few times the volume is kind of low i wish it was louder so when driving i could hear the person clearer however ive been told that i can be heard just fine playing music is fine since it connects right through my phone it does not have a camera you cannot verbally write your text messages and i still have not completely figured out how to add numbers to the phone book all in all its actually a pretty good watch for the price play around with the watch for awhile you shall  you will eventually love it the inside of the band is completely rubber and i do not sweat which is good it looks exactly the same as it does in the pictures,neutral

i have been using this phone for a couple of weeks now and everything works perfectly i purchased a new unit instead of a used or refurbished unit based on other reviewers having problems with their purchases of those types of units this new unit comes with the android  operating system a must if you are planning on rooting your phone i have used all the major functions and have had no issues since i already had one of the samsung galaxy s units prior to ordering this one i knew what to looktest for i think the most important thing to know when ordering a replacement cell phone is who the seller is check the seller reviews and the product reviews i notice that many folks did not mention who they had purchased a phone from  when i compared the poor reviews to the reviews the customers gave the sellers it became easy to see who was selling a quality productlast but certainly not least i purchased the s because the s is like holding a dinner plate to your face samsung is supposed to be coming out with a smaller size s but it is not available yet at tmobile or in my area,neutral

the nokia lumia  is an excellent unlocked phone hands down however buyers should be aware that the accessories that come with the mobile headset charger usb cable are not nokia products but standard tools this information is not made available by the seller and one would expect that having purchased an authentic nokia product it would come with nokia accessories in my assessment this omission is deceptive,neutral

my average rating is not a reflection on the seller or the hardware it is a reflection on the annoyance of working around the fact it is an att phonefirst of all the phone was new although the box seemed to have been opened previously everything was great as is always the case buying through amazon i popped in a tmobile sim and a gb microsd and everything just worked well so  starsi subtracted  stars because there was no indication of what a nightmare the att branding implies in all fairness there has  there is no reason why the seller would know this so im hoping to inform my fellow shoppers the seller did advertise as an att unlocked phone which is accurate however the att branding essentially means it has  it is nearly impossible to patch or update the device let me be clear just like with your computer you need to update  patch your phone there are too many vulnerabilities exploits and malware out there for you to just buy a smartphone and use it without ever patching and unless you are using it with an att sim you cannot get overtheair updates which is the mechanism that seamlessly pushes patches to you like with iphones as of october   my device was running android lollipop  which has known security issues and yet there was no consumerfriendly way to patch it over the air at the time of this review the current version of android is marshmallow my recommendation if you are not a computer geek do not buy this phone unless you intend to use it on attif you are a geek you can search for the firmware updates and download the att branded image gb and the usb drivers and then flash the phone read wipe load new firmware and completely reinstall everything on your phonei spent  hours last night researching and executing the update and reinstalling  reconfiguring the phone in hindsight it would have been smarter to buy an unbranded phone for about  more and not have any of these headaches and lastly i considered editing the firmware update script it has  it is a very simple bat or sh and removing the check that forces you to use the att firmware hoping i could simply flash the unbranded firmware update all indications are that i will brick the phone if i do so is it a scare tactic possibly but i cannot afford to turn my purchase into a paperweight,neutral
battery door is slightly loosen due to mfr defect,neutral
i really like it the only thing i do not like is that i cannot snap shot and i cannot save my pictures to my phone off of a social network,neutral
the phone would be better if the apps for it were not horrible hardly has the apps that google play has you cannot download apps from other stores and the apps that are available such as facebook or map my run do not work right,neutral
does not have all the specs i was expecting in a samsung phone,neutral
great phone but the charger port got loose when i only used the charger that came with the phonethe sensors were also wacky especially the gyroscope,neutral
did a lot of research before making my purchase great phone with outstanding style but one thing that got me worried was the startup of the phone it did not start up like a new phone would so it got me thinking that wireless everything might have sold me a used one also i checked the phone app and it shows  calls made on this phone for me ill keep it as it looks brand new with no scuffs but just keep that in mind when purchasing through amazon,neutral
i had to exchange the  blackberry for a blackberry  because it would not work on the network i do not really care for the  blackberry phone i like the  blackberry better,neutral
the device is not totally new is start before,neutral
it has  it is an ok phone good features but freezes quite often battery compartment seems not secure i ordered this from the seller phone max and will never purchase anything from them my phone started freezing up  would not even turn on for factory reset until i take the battery out  after weeks of use and the seller gave me a new battery assuming that its a battery issue that did not fix the problem when i contacted them again the response was that the warranty time has expired so no refund is possible i think this seller is trying to get rid of some defective phones they have cheating people like me so buyers be aware it may look bit cheaper than other sellers but avoid phone max or you will be repenting later terrible service from the sellervincents,neutral
i have noticed that this case is not as tight or s well made as other otterbox cases i have owned material such as dust and moisture can get under the covering on the main screen there are also wrinkles in the plastic over the main button which means fingerprint id does not work well will be looking at other brands from now on,neutral
needed a cheap phone bb sucks,neutral
i bought this for the  screen and the  battery i was looking forward to having a affordable phone with good specs and long battery life the device looks very good with golden metal finish it has a high end look but i have to say while battery performance has matched my expectations the screen has not yes it hd so it looks sharp and clear but the image rendering is somewhat flat and lacks luster with no options to adjust anything but brightness u can not adjust contrast level or saturation since i am a photographer and like to show my work on my phone occasionally this is a problem the pics look flat the shadows are not deep colors do not pop and skin tones are not so pleasing color rendering and white balance seem off and this is in comparison to similar price point devices i have such as posh titan ea or idroid royal v which is actually lower res screen also running benchmark on it i found d and ram performance low again my posh device preformed better and got higher total scoresupdate bluetooth connectivity is choppy with some devices it skips compated to my other devicesphones also touch screen responsiveness is either under sensitive or slow at times and other times flikery blu please upgrade screen quality increase and improve ram size and internal storage size and u will have amazing phone that will preform in a way that matches the high end look of the device i would pay an extra  for such upgrades,neutral

i am buying these for the two landlines i transferred to tmobile i have a personal cell spot so reception is superb in my house however the phone seemed to drop connection when not being used when i click on call button to turn on the screen i often see the connections of both lines in emergency or unavailable status but then will connect to tmo after a a few seconds the call quality is spotty at best when i take the phone to a starbucks next door the phone lost cell signalsso the phone is kind of in working condition in my house and seemed to be useless when traveling i am giving it  stars since it works sometimes in my house and does what i need for now the radio and flashlights are also good features if i do not use it as a phone long term,neutral
did not come with sim card will not recommend it it took me forever to find a sim card for itlame,neutral
its okay to used but you cant used any and every headpiece on it it also freeze now and then,neutral
phone works great and was instantly activated with no problem at the att store has capacity for two sim cards if you are a international traveleronly issues is that the phone lacks an attachment point for a leash a major pain for anyone keeping it in a purse or bag and the second display has few personalization optionsgood functional phone at a great price for anyone who does not want or need a smart phone and no  yr contractonly three stars due to lack of leash,neutral
ive brought this because i was looking for a budget phone and this phone meets my needs the problem im having is the bluetooth goes out for a second when streaming music which is a bummer since im a music lover another thing is the volume is extremely low as others have said when using speaker or just talking on it this is the reason i gave it  stars,neutral
is good cellphone,neutral
nice simple phone i use for when out of houseprinted manual on how to use and dissapointed not much help with the manual i got more information from comments on the internet about the phone than the manual,neutral
first off full disclosure  i bought this to replace a  month old droid mini which i dropped and cracked the screen which is a much faster phonewhen i bought it the headline advertised it as newit is definitely not battery life is consistent with a  year old phone not a new one i have tried turning off every battery drain on the device location background data screen brightness etc and i cannot make it  hours without needing to charge it the other big thing is the usb chargedata port only works as a charge port i cannot connect it to computer to transfer files to it far from perfect but not a huge deal breaker for mebut i do like the phone itself it is not as fast or responsive as my droid mini but it does not have the processor speed or ram of a mini it will run  of the apps that the mini would with the exceptions being apps that require the gyro feature but it beat buying a new mini for just be warned that this is not a new phone,neutral
this watches comes in without chargers and wonder how we could charge on the go,neutral
it came only the phone no accesories,neutral
first i got a cheap china knock off i had read the reviews before buying and was aware that quite a few people have had this same problem and was looking out for it it did not say otterbox on it anywhere and the underside was plane i called amazon customer service and explained the problem pointed out other reviews that i read pointed out the picture and description said i would be getting a real otterbox they were very helpful and told me to do whatever with the fake and they would refund the money and i could reorder it to try again i reordered it when i was still on the phone with customer service and the guy told me he was making a note on it to see that it was an otterbox and not a fake and that has  that is the best he could do when the second one came it was in a nicer bag that was thicker and resealed and looked just like the picture with otterbox on it and had markings on the underside with a patent number and other numbers ive been using it for a week and am happy with it so far the clip that said otterbox on it seems thicker nicer plastic the biggest difference being in the belt clip it releases better turns easier and looks nicer,neutral
it did what it was supposed to do,neutral
the phone was beautiful coming out the box i brought the phone in gold it looks like and feels like a premium phone but that is where it stopspro  beautiful color feels and looks like premium phone  comes with case earbuds and screen protector  decent camera  battery charges quickly and last a little better than average smartphone  touch screen is responsive and moves smoothlycons  the volume is low and sounds tinny with or without earbuds which was a deal breaker for me i tried numerous earbuds with same result  case feels flimsy and there are very few cases listed on amazon that are appealing for this product  i do not think it has gorilla glass which is disappointing since the energy x has gorilla overall if this fits your budget it is still a decent enough phone if blu made improvements to the audio and added gorilla glass i would definitely say it would give premium phones a run for their money,neutral
thought this came with a camera was disspointed but works ok,neutral
everything everyone says about the battery is true  lasts  days on a single charge amazing so it gets one star per day of charge just for thisbig negative is voice recognition you have to perform several keystrokes just to activate it and then it does not recognize half your words compare this with nexus  my prior phone where voice recognition is embedded in everything so you can activate it by touching a microphone icon or sometimes strictly by voice command and the recognition is excellent also lg voice is too chatty heres an example me text staceylg texting stacy what would you like to text   confirm you wish to text this to stacy done texting staceysheesh just text stacey alreadyim returning this phone and switching back to onestroke reliable silent nexus,neutral

overall is a great phone with high build quality but heres some design preference that came up to me after using for a month originally an iphone  userplusluxury feelgreatly builtsuperb screenrich dual soundsfast cpu speedneutralim used to holding the phone with left hand and turning the volume with my left thumb ip  s are on left side however this tiny thin volume button is on the right side forcing myself to hold the phone w my right hand instead of leftno physical buttons to turn on the screen resulting in only the power button to turn on the screen s is a better design as it is located on the side for easier accessthe power button is flat on the top of the phone causing inconvenience to find the button every time i turn on the screen the button also get scratch up easily as it acts as an ir blaster if they separate the ir and power button would be betterthe sense home and back button are not as consistent in sensing which can cause frustrations at timesonly two buttons on the bottom instead of three with an awkward design of home button on the bottom right instead of the middle this causes user to use the second hand to access home instead of one hand due to the button either too far from the left thumb or too close to the right thumbthe reception never gets full bar maybe due to the aluminum cover my max is always  even on the streetstakes a long time to fully charge  hours vs min for iphone poor quality handfree as recipient cannot hear clearly unless i hold the mic up close to my mouthfor personal preference although htc one seems to be better than s in many aspect s seems to be a better transition for iphone users than htc one,neutral
i received the phone quickly but am disappointed to say that the headphone auxiliary cord plug in does not work one reeson for wanting the iphone was for music paid a decent price for a manufacturer refurbished phone and it does not completely work,neutral
so i started using this phone about  or  months ago and have recently come to this decision to ditch it for a nokia e i will list the pros and the cons i think that the nokia n hasprosnice and eyecatching designmany friends really liked the look of the phone and the sliding keyboard really excited some peoplesatisfying web browsingit has been really nice to look at some muchvisited web pages and do some shopping online with the phone most web sites load quickly and fullynice camerapretty decent music playeri used this phone with a gb card full of music as my primary headphone music player most of the summerlarge screenconswidgets are a mixed bagmost of them are not really useful and would not connect consistentlylock key on side of the phone has been a real painsometimes it would work then not work then not unlock get stuck etcthe touchscreen is just soooo not smooth and slick i would often wonder if i had pressed something hard enough or not hard enoughqwerty keyboard is not very easy to use the character button is right next to the space button so i was constantly calling up a page of characters at the wrong time which really slows down typingon screen numeric keypad is ok for t typing but very clumsy i am a very heavy texter and this got so frustrating for the amount of backspacing and deleting for most text messagesnot pleasing photo gallerythe biggest problem i felt with this was just how unattractive it looks i once had a nokia n and the way it displayed the photos was very streamlined and neat looking this device just lays them all out with no styling and also near the end of my using the device it would take so long to load that it got kind of embarrassing if i were trying to show someone a photogeneral bulkiness of the devicehigh price tagand finally i just got tired of it turning off unexpectedly rebooting itself not being able to unlock it with the lock key etcso as you can see it really is not a bad phone it just fell way short of my expectations for a nokia flagship phone and also as a touchscreen device i ordered the e out of sheer frustration and the desire to get away from a touchscreen ive only had the e for a few days but in spite of the smaller screen i now have a smaller easily pocketable phone with a very very very nice qwerty keyboard and a traditional keypad for t texting very happy with my new phone and kinda glad i do not have to deal with the frustration of all the ns inconsistencies thanks for reading,neutral
ive done so much research on this phone before buying it and after using it for  months i am ready for an indepth review based on real world experiencethe goodi enjoy the ability to hold and manipulate my device with one hand the blackberry classic handles this aspect like no other phone i have used being very familiar with the android os and being a former bb user i can honestly say that the blackberry  os is definitely highlighted on this device the swipe controls are probably one of the most intuitive on the market you can easily go from one application to the next with just a quick swipe a lot of people have commented on the ease of the blackberry hub and if you are constantly getting emails and fb updates and text messages then you will appreciate this feature the most the build of the classic is very sturdy and the phone carries some serious weight compared to to other devices i personally like it because it makes me feel like i have a premium device in handthe camera is honestly nothing to write home about it is mediocre at best the hdr is super slow processing the shot in my opinion compared to other devices like the note  or newer devices which is a let down since this one is newer by comparison the call quality is great i love how sensitive the receiver is it seems like no matter where i place the phone i am heard clearly the speaker however i will address laterbattery life isehhhhh if you are struggling to get or keep a signal or are texting like crazy then you will certainly notice the drain on your battery the screen sensitivity is pretty responsive however some of the lag might be attributed to the appswhich i will discuss later as well in the us the lte on this phone is outstanding and the os makes downloads and uploads fast really fast tmobiles network is the one i have used and they have the feature of wifi calling that comes with an update this feature is great if you are in an area where you do not have signal but have wifibut how often does that happen right anyway the wifi calling definitely takes away from the call quality so be mindful if you are using that feature or really any wifi calling app like whatsapp because the difference in call quality is apparent with this devicethe keyboard the keyboard the keyboardit is awesome it takes some time to get used to it especially using a full touch screen for so long but when you do your texting game will go from like  to  i have man sized hands what does that mean right and at first i felt like the keys were way too small but after a week or two of using it i slowly forgot my initial complaint and you will too im surethe badguys you will not find the apps you are used to in the apple store or play store you just will not but you have the option of side loading an app called snap which will give you access to google play sounds great right wellnot so fast although you certainly can find your favorite apps to a degree on either the amazon blackberry or google play stores the quality of the apps will not be the same when crossing os platforms the apps made for android devices are buggy and i mean really frustratingly buggyit will make you want to scream the number of native apps for blackberry has not improved much over the years and hopefully with the priv now on the scene perhaps blackberry will integrate the best of bb with android from now on or better yet patch an update through that does it for all their bb devices a guy can dream righti also have to say that i am really upset that the phone has only one speaker at the bottom of the device it appears that there are two pretty good sized speakers ready to go but on further investigation and volume manipulation i am sad to say there is only one and its not the best what has  what is even worse is that i dropped my phone which is shielded in a case mind you and i lost the use of that speaker on the first drop no speaker phone no ringing no youtube videos nothinghow sad is that does that speak about the build quality of the phone i think so but i did drop it so i guess i cannot pin all the blame on blackberry i guesslong story short it is a good phone not a great one but definitely better than the old bb bold if you are all about productivity and apps mean nothing to your life then this is definitely your phone emails come quickly your life is arranged in the hub so well it hurts and the ability to type long emails is a huge life saver but for the average person who wants to check your ig account make your pictures prettier with filters or play subway surfer as you wait in the doctors officei do not recommend itthe os is a marked improvement from blackberrys other os but its not for everyone the lack of apps the glitchy behaviors you get when you sideload and speaker quality may irritate you enough to regret your buy so before you buy please read thischeers shoppersupdate so this is an update on the blackberry classic a phone that i had high hopes for butthat did not hold up the phone in spite of its glitches and slower than normal response time i still tried to love this phone but the final strawis when the speaker just quit on methatt rightit quit no rings for phone calls no listening to videos music or even a caller on speaker phoneabsolutely no soundive had the phone only  months and a few days and its value is completely shattered by this one aspect that highlights why all the other failing aspects were truly telltale signs i am trying to contact amazoncom llc since the phone was sold by them and apparently i cannot return the defective device or get a refundreally all i want is an exchangeeven if it is a refurbished phoneblackberry is even less help as they tell you to contact the seller to hash out your issuesupdate okay people i usually do not update an update but as of about a week ago i was having issues with the speaker on my classic it has always been in a case and that has  that is because we drop phones all the time i mean really who has never dropped their phoneanyway after one drop from a fairly short distance i noticed that the speaker completely went out i thought maybe it was the sound settingsummm nope then i thought it was just a software glitchummm nope the last conclusion was that the speaker sustained some damage and because of that the phone went silent now here is where it gets crazy a friend of mine says hey why do not you just drop it again and maybe that will fix it now in my mind i am laughing because what a stupid thing to say right and to tell you the truth i did drop it again on purpose soon after and nothing happened however i took his advice a few days later by trying to show someone how you could not crack the screen on this phone so i dropped it from a fairly high distance and viola the speaker turned back on and now it works perfectly i do not know what to say or think about this but it definitely affected the rating i give the classic though not as high as it once was it is a sturdy phone and it has its faults to say the least but it has now become my backup and im comfortable with thatby the way blackberry offers no support in the event your phone is damaged you and the seller have to hash it out and if it has  it is past the time period for returns then its all on you keep that in mindcheers,neutral
not too bad a product,neutral
the os has its flaws like calling back from a text brings you to a black page where you have to hit back and then call to make the call the base memory is only  gig and its cumbersome to move apps to the memory card and even so  gig is very little even for cache and os stuff,neutral
a little short on memory gb but windows mobile os does not require muchcompact budget phone that gets the job done without breaking the bankas with any budget phone a little slow for things like touch response but overall dos aokjust temper your expectations  it has  it is not a galaxy s or a high end wp so do not compare to one,neutral

the case is great in terms of the protection it offers it survived a day at the beach multiple runs including heavy rain and a water ride at a theme parkthe downside is the voice quality the phone has from the moment the case was put on people have a hard time hearing me i have to raise my voice even when i open the charging port cover next to the microphone which helps but minimally,neutral

like a number of reviewers before me i also was disappointed that the phone did not come with a manual in english i do not understand how a responsible seller like amazon will sell a product that buyers can not use for lack of a manual that they can read i read the previous reviews that noted that the manual that went with the phone was in spanish but i ordered the phone anyway assuming that the problem had been corrected because so many others had already flagged it as a problem amazon customer service at first told me that there was no english manual available for this phone but i read bulldgs dec   review in which he stated that tracey in amazons mobile phone tech support had found a manual for him customer service referred me to fred in mobile tech support who sent me a manual by email which i downloaded and printed thank you fred but why did i have to go to all this trouble just to get a manual which should have been supplied with the product,neutral

perfect cellphone no scratches but the charger is not original and it broke order an additional cable and charger and you will not have any problems,neutral

my son wanted a watch so i researched all over amazons choices this watch seemed to be excellent it came in i did not even open it just gave it to my son excited he has  he is  and a tech junkie he took one look at it and tossed it aside he has  he is about  feet tall and a big guy so it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him he said the watch face itself is much too huge too thick too big for him to wear he did not like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it altogether and was not interested in it any further he left on the table beside him and did not give it a second look even though i advised him all it could do nope not even remotely interested because it was too big i tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him ive still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago im keeping it though hoping that one day it will be useful to me im thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes but i really cannot speak up on it i have not used it no one wants to wear such a thick faced watch so the technical features have not yet been experienced so if i do take the time to find someone to use it i will be sure to update you on that the three stars is only that no one wants to wear it,neutral

lol this was pretty ridiculous it has a ton of almost use able features none of the apps you are supposed to download actually works with it used  different phones it will however bluetooth sync with your phone take calls pictures play music not bad for the tiny little speaker and give you a general idea whether or not you should splurge on a super expensive name brand smart watch cool gadget to give to a kid to play with and have a smartwatch of their own without worry about spending an arm and a leg,neutral

i bought my phone through amazon i followed the instructions got the phone in may cause i live in the caribbean and i shipped the orders to my family in the us delivery was good but in july i use the phone as the instructions let the battery run completely down then charge i did that for days but to no avail the battery was not charging so i contacted topphone they were nice they send me a new battery which was all good then a month later the phone started to over heat i had to stick it out of the window while driving again i contacted the sellers and may be i was a bother to them but they failed to answer my email on my over heating phone now a year later it is over heating and the touch screen have to be replaced and the charger does not work properly to charge the phone the phone in it self is a good phone great features but it have glitches  be very aware some sellers are wolves i sheep clothing,neutral

i ordered this phone on amazon through just cellular i ordered the new phone but it did not come in its original box it does not look brand new it did not come with the manual book for the phone and it did not come with its original phone charger the charger is different and only about  feet long very short compared to normal chargers its the cheap charger that they have for sell for  so i guess they take the nice one out of the box from your new phone and give you the cheap crappy charger so they can sell the other one for a better price not sure it did ship on the th of the  to  day business shipping days so that was good so far the phone is working well but if i need another phone i will not be ordering it through just cellular and i would advise others not to as well,neutral
update bought another for a loyal bb fan who was excited about upgrading their phone turns out the toolbelt had a manufacturing issue on day one it started to get warped when the phone was in use due to heat and made a squeaky sound when pressed also the plastic covering the toolbelt was starting to lift off on the right side seems like there was a manufacturing issue with the adhesive underneath the plastic have returned and have not decided whether or not to rebuy this giftcontext i wanted to like this phone and i want blackberry to succeed as i think competition is good for the market and variety is good for consumers i have owned many blackberries in the past at least  of them over the years i do not care about the lack of apps on this platform so that is not even a consideration yes i was running the latest version of the os at the time summary i am extremely disappointed with this phone and regretfully will be returning itreasons this device is extremely slow try loading a pdf into adobe reader zoom in and scroll around you will actually have to wait for the pdf to redraw before the image becomes sharp again i was shocked by that the keys are nice and typing is easy but the keys are very loud ive literally had people turn and glare at me while im typing on the phone the phone is not exactly stable in a weeks time ive had the phone freeze and crash at least a dozen times i had not downloaded and installed any new apps on the device the device has a nice weighty feel to it that makes it feel substantial and dare i say professional however that weight and the relative balance of the device in my hands made my hands fatigue after  minutes of typing notes i can see my hands starting to cramp with continued use i expected very little from the camera however it was worse than expected it is horrible at focusing especially when you zoom in im not talking about trying to use this for artistic purposes instead imagine trying to get a photo of a slide presentation at a meeting what i got too often was blurry results no it has  it is not becase i have unusually shaky hands has not happened with non bb devices ive used poor battery life because the battery is not changeable there has  there is not even the possiblity of carrying a backup batteryit saddens me to write the above i hope that bb stays in the hardware game i hope bb can take all the feedback positive and negative and continue to improvefor the time being goodbyeps i rarely write reviews but am doing so mostly as feedback to bb,neutral

the basics of purchasing something is getting what you ask for i ordered a black phone but instead got a white phone the product itself is good but for a company to make a mistake like this is just plain scary main reason for purchasing is for the dual sims and i am loving that so far device quickly was updated to  it runs well but gets hot at some weird times i dont mean warm i mean you cant miss the fact that it is hot i have had two instances when i look at it and it is off these have been registered as system incidents was reading up on these incidents and i am a bit concerned these situations are different from from restarts that i have triggered be squeezing the door outside the dual sim area i assume that when i squeeze there i move the sim underneath and this triggers a restart i can live with that because my sims were cut screen is lovely its loud enough so i dont miss calls camera is good it switches between apps effortlessly and well its a good phoneso far,neutral

having this phone for only a day leaves me with the impression that all i will be doing will be making phone calls with it what jumps out at me is the poor screen resolution and weak display the phone is replacing a nokia  that was used for calls texts and an occasional game the  had a solid display that was easily read for the occasional text message and navigating through the menus the  screen is terrible i can hardly make out anything that is on it and i dread the task of entering contact informationsince my needs are basic i think that the  will be adequate but i will not be raving about how a good a phone it isi will follow up with more if anything stands out after more usethere was no problem with entering contact information worked out just fine,neutral

ill skip the detailed review as there are already numerous ones of those this is one of the best valued phones on the market however  weeks after receiving mine it automatically went into guest mode guest mode is annoying because you cannot view your pictures see call logs and probably numerous other things i never discovered there is no setting called guest mode so do not waste your time trying to find it ie there is no way to turn this mode off i know this because i just got off the phone with blu it took me  phone calls and finally reaching a supervisor to get a fix they email you a apk file which does fix the problem till this is fixed however id leave the  stars simply because all  technicians solution was for me to do a hard reset to get out of guest mode took supervisor intervention to actually solve this,neutral
it operates fine for normal use but i used it for work to type report logs on and it was not working efficiently,neutral
good colors but the rubber outing does not fit perfectly,neutral

it was good while it lasted but it broke a month into its use,neutral
satisfied with my purchace,neutral
work well for the price,neutral
it says in the description that  batteries were included however the package came with only one battery the manual is horrible it did not tell how to install the sim card you will need to go to youtube to find out how to do it otherwise the phone is a simple cheap phone it does what it does so for the price i will give  stars,neutral
it has  it is a awesome phone but the one i got had scratches and dings on it wish it had more memory,neutral
we traveled to italy in early may moved here actually and we were told to buy a phone ahead of time i bought these phones for my husband and myself wellwhen we finally arrived in italy purchased the sim card and tried to activate the phones it was very archaic thinking id find that old fashioned worm game on it and horrid we only activated one of the phones and the other one is still sitting in the box the next day we just went to one of the phone providers and purchased a phone from them we will keep the phones for guests that come to townbut overall if youve had an iphone or any type of other awesome smartphone then this isnt the best buy for you,neutral

the phone works perfectly fine and it has  it is in good conditions but the charger and the headphones were not original apple products,neutral
the battery is very nice but the phone itself is very slow and prone to freezefreakout opening apps on this phone is quite a task the app takes a while and occasionally the app that opens is not the one that i clicked on for the price it is still not a bad phone but i would spring for one that has a bit more processing power to avoid frustration,neutral
too fragilecould be better reinforced with stronger plastic or metal back cover,neutral
good phone like brand new but had a hairline crack on the screen,neutral
this is nice watch if you are looking for receiving calls and few basic functions its great i thought its full android watch so i can use apps like golf gps etc but those does not work if you are using phones app only then this is great product for that price,neutral
fits perfect and does its job at protecting the phone however these otterboxs need replacing every few months because the outer rubber skin gets worn our and stops fitting right also the screen protector gets scratched up dirt collects inside the case also so it has to be taken apart and cleaned occasionally which is not always an easy task one more thing this case is pink and purple not red and blue like it kind of looks like in the picture im a  year old man walking around with a pink and purple phone,neutral
pros small sleek and light i find this phone to be just as elegant if not more then the iphone pictures look nice as does the screen resolutioncons once fully charged to  the battery slipped down to  in a matter of  min of surfing the web once i connected this phone with tmobile i noticed the lack of signal where i had  bars of g reception on my gs i now have  on this phone unable to update on any networks other then attsummary this phone looks very attractive and runs nicely but the poor antenna battery life and inability to update firmware holds the phone back i would recommend this phone to some one who is willing to put up with these problems but id also recommend saving up an extra  and investing it into a better phone,neutral

ive had this phone for about  months before i dropped it on its screen for the first time and it crackedusually with a cracked screen a phone is still functional that is not the case for the idol it was fine at first it has a really nice design and great display the camera could be better but i cant complain about that considering the price tagthe only thing other than the cracked screen problem was that the phone was oddly buggycertain apps i would use like snapchat or miitomo would just stop responding whenever i used them,neutral

the specs and functionality is this phone is great def better then windows phoneits a waste lumia  is windows and android the only problem i had with this is that its made in china and i do not know if the specsstandard for china is low or something but the battery life is horrible ive let drained completely on first day used and shut down to charge complete repeated over xs bc this is suppose to help prolong the battery since its new unfortunately the battery lasts only about hrs with minimal use and i have all the things on it off and lowered to preserve power already too this phone is suppose to last about hrs so if you are getting a n i deff recommend but not ones made from china i love this phone just sad it was not the right oneshould have gotten the white one instead,neutral

the phone itself is great everything i wanted at a great price im using it to make voip calls over wifi without a cell phone plan using google talk and google voice knitted together by the groove ip appunlike others however my phone arrived with a nonstandard android  build i suspect it was overstock from a carrier but whatever the reason the os build id was not listed by google and the phone was not receiving overtheair updates from googledue to a wifi bug in android  that caused the phone to lose wifi connectivity when the screen shuts off i could not use the phone as i wanted until i got a software update  so i had to go through the process of rooting it and installing an official  build myself which is not for the faint of heartthe seller contacted me and explained that unlocked in this context means only that the phone can be used with a sim card on multiple gsm carriers it does not mean that the phones bootloader is unlocked unlocking the bootloader was necessary on my unit to install a standard android build and receive overtheair updates from google unlocking the bootloader also voids the warranty though this was not an issue for me since the phone was out of warranty anywaythe phone now works perfectly and is receiving updates from google five stars for its present state  but only three for the disabled locked state i got it in,neutral
some things about this phone are sort of unforgivable example  default clock app the stopwatch and timer will reset by itself this renders them useless obviously example  maps gps is not accurate crashes almost every time i have it navigate bluetooth is not reliable connecting to my car its a great phone otherwise i love the size,neutral
came in good condition but cannot make it work for my carrier try it later for overseas use,neutral

battery life is very poor for a phone especially for one that is deemed as a travel phone with dual sims i took this phone with me to europe and in general it operated ok but i found the volume from the phone to be inadequate compared to my zte valet that i use at home the battery is inadequate as i found my cellphone dying before the end of each day despite charging it up fully at night when you are traveling you need a phone that will stay powered up to assist you with gps mapping  direction apps etc i kept powering off to save power but it seems if you run a google maps navigation app it will suck the battery power pretty quick not good for travel unless you are always near a power source to keep topping off the battery which can add to potential memory issues i returned it,neutral
this is my second smart phone i have ordered different seller for the first in a week this one finally came and when i purchase a black phone it would be nice not to receive a brown phone with the sticker placed on it saying black and yes there is a noticeable difference but i need a cell phone for work and do not have time to return yet again another phone so if your not in a hurry for a phone check it first and return it if its wrong,neutral

update  continued customer service problems with great call causes me to further roll back my recommendation on this phone this is key because great call is the only company you deal with when you own a jitterbug turns out great call has been charging me for two phones rather than replacing one with the other it took  phone calls and  different reps to get someone to understand the issue and begin to clear it up in the meantime great call has disabled my online access to my account as it was associated with the previous phones number and makes it more difficult to make sense of the overbilling that great call has done so far ive been very patient but the inability to correct this simple mistake has been maddening to say the leastthis is our nd jitterbug replacing one that was dropped and found the next day after a hard rain so they are not  am not waterproof  my parents love the simplicity of the jitterbug and find it very easy to use these are the same folks who do not know how how to retrieve voicemail or send a text just wish coverage in their area ne pa was better great call customer service has been pretty good until this phone replacement but they have started double billing me rather than replace the original phone with this phone multiple calls to great call have yet to get a resolution to the issue very frustrating to require so much time and effort to get what should be a simple transaction correctly registered with great call,neutral

before i decided to buy this phone numerous reviews and researches had been done then this phone became my final choicethis is a decent phone there are quite a few concerns online over the battery screen resolution and the main cameras lack of optical image stabilizerwell id like to say that after having this phone for couple of days the only thing i do not find entirely satisfying is the main camera although it comes with  mega pixels the quality of the photos really is not any better than the main camera on the lg g which has  mega pixelsthe xp screen is great and sometime can be rather too bright but such problem can be taken care of by dialing the brightness down several notchesbattery wise when it has  it is fully charged two mins movies on netflix  plus photographs taken with flash on and off web browsing numerous text messages exchange on two messengers all done in the time span of  hours can be sustained by the battery with still  leftit also does not take more than two hours to fully charge the battery despite some reviews online i have noticed that it has taken about a minute to charge a little more than  of the power from  to  the battery on my phone took about  minutesanother thing is that i have watched a review on you tube about somebody claiming that this phone does not allow apps to be saved on the additional memory card well i have no problem transfer most of my apps on to the sd card so just for the referenceanyway for a midrange phone at this price it is not bad,neutral

ever since tmobile dropped the data plan for this phone it has become extremely limited in its potential uses all you can use it for is texting no vibrating or ringtones when you receive a message you can have it alert you every  minutes if you have a message calling playing music taking average pictures and its organizer for events notes and tasks im sure you can go online and install apps themes games and stuff like that onto a computer and then put it onto the phone via usb cable but i have no clue if that will workfinal word based on the limited features this phone is for a person that only really texts and nothing else and this phone is the epitome of why you should research before you buy a product i will give it a  out of  since it is still a good phone besides how retarded it has become when it lost its data plan,neutral

no doubt about it this phone is everything the reviews say a beautiful screen great sound great battery i have not noticed a lag at all i clear my tasks regularly this phone will offer a flagship experienceeditafter using the phone for a few months it has  it is not the ultra flagship i accuses it of being initially still not bad but for the money there are better now the cpu uses littlebig allowing it to swap between a strong and weak quadcore solution to match the needthe issuethe weaker cpu cluster is seriously weak daily tasks and normal use suffers severely multitasking is not superb with even  or  items open and the biggest issuethe phone keeps going berzerk i have never dropped it damaged ive never broken even a screen on a smartphone in my life so that has  that is not it this phone screen starts flickering rapid image distortions like i dropped it in a pool blue screens and fast flickers,neutral
the phone i purchased said it was carrier branded and comes in the original t mobile boxbut instead an att phone arrived in an att boxthis is some bs because my internet wont work,neutral

this phone allows the person to roam the internet but they cannot download anything from the internet i had brought this phone to download from the internet apps in order to talk with my fiance outside of america this phone does not allow anyone to do anything like that the phone does not come unlocked as well so if anyone wants an unlocked phone this is not the phone for you the phone looks new and it has a great battery life speaking about batteries it does not come with one nor does it come with a sim and memory card for that matter the person has to buy those things before even using the product other than that it is a great phone,neutral
im just an average lady definitely not a tech head so if any of my complaints can be fixed please tell methis phone is just for personal use i do not need a high end phone with a million features they are all too big anywayi know this phone is inexpensive but so is the lumia so comparing the two is faircoming from a lumia  i am not at all impressed with this battery life from a full charge it has  it is down to  after a  minute facebook check ive turned off most apps that can run in the background and the display is on low brightness there are some apps that do not give you achoice to turn off in the background but according to the battery saver they do not use up very much i do not know what else i could do suggestions welcome my lumia would still be at a full charge after just  minutesthere has  there is no block call feature i found that feature very very useful for avoiding those cruises i keep winning and the weird pharmacy callsthere are a few apps that do not work with this phone nothing to cry about thoughthe camera is definitely better than the lumia because it has a flash which is nice ive never used my phone in place of a camera but the improvement from the lumia is definitely noticeablei like the size it has  it is bigger but not ginormous like most phones i can carry it in my pocket still but i do have to use both hands when i use itthe display is a nice size and very clear and the sound is nice tooas it stands at the moment i might switch back to my lumia but im on the fence ill keep this as a spare because i did not spend a lot for itif i get any tips that improve its performance ill update this review,neutral
i loved this phone till it crapped out on me got a new windows phone and love it more then the iphone will never go back to an apple product again microsoft soooooooo much better people,neutral
good phone but the screen cracked on the first fall probably weaker of the smartphones out there,neutral
i liked this product was very use full just like new and enjoyed using it but needs to be updated,neutral
the phone seems to work well so far but it was not a verizon phone as advertised i had to go with the less reliable att network to make use of the phone,neutral
first at  this item should have qualified for free shipping but i was charged over  shsecondly the ad did not state this was an international version which required a european sim card to make it work i discovered this only when it arrived fortunately i managed to borrow a german sim card from a distant friend to wake up the phone only then could i use an american tmobile sim card that was a false and misleading adthe phone itself is ok i just did not appreciate being put to all that trouble to make it work,neutral
everything about this phone is very good except one thing the rear facing camera is disappointing pictures are far from being good the front facing camera is very goodother than that i really like it,neutral
for the life if me cannot get this thing to receive texts calls are fine texts are sent fine but nothing u do fixed the issue,neutral
it has  it is good for my  year old usage i just wish the phone lock works and the alarm works,neutral
it is working well it was a replacement for my blu vivo hd and is a real improvement with gb of ram instead of the gb that the vivo hashowever both phones share at least two design flaws imho the battery is nonremovable so you cannot have a charged spare when the other dies and also both phones have the loudspeakerbuzzer in the back near the bottom so if you place them over a lined table or other soft surface facing up you may not hear an alarm notification or callalso another annoyance that should have been documented but is not these phones do not have dualstandby that means that if you receive or make a call on one line the other one gets blocked both calls and data during the call i thought that being a newer model it would have such a feature as i said it is not documented anywhere,neutral
the phone works but we are wondering where is the earphone of it,neutral
i had problems with this item it was supposed to be unlocked but it was blockedi contacted the seller and they tried to help me to solve itafter a couple of weeks i got the phone unblock and the seller sent me a complimentary because of the inconveniencesfor sure the phone should be unlocked without requiring extra work but was remarkable their interest for customers satisfaction,neutral
pictures cannot be texted to this phone this is very disappointing,neutral
good phone for the money,neutral
so many apps you can not get on a widows phone the bigger issue is i have a blu cell as well and they both have the same carrier yet when side by side i often have no service or low bars on this phone while the other has full bars and shows lte data i have to assume its the phone,neutral
so far i like this watch however i cannot recommend it first the instructions were very obviously written by a person who is not literate in english it was written by someone speaking chinese using an english language dictionary here is a typical sentence browser need your phone have sim card and can surf the internetplease agree the phone book sync otherwise there is no called phone book further the instructions as such are totally incompletethe fm radio will not function always asking for nonexisting ear phones for a watch with no ear phone socket i have no idea how to send a message and there is nothing in the so called instructions to give me a cluefor the price i like this watch because of its independent functionsthe band broke and i have no idea how to replace it im buying a replacement band for a similarly looking phone and hoping for the best,neutral
case broke within  weeks great if youre not going to open it a lot,neutral
seller is psxpro when i ordered this phone it said it was an unlocked international lg g but when i got it it was a verizon unlocked model witch had a small crack on the top of the phone which should have been described in the description i was on the phone for  days with my service provider setting up my cricket wireless apn settings and had to install a rd party app to get picture messages mms over all the phone works good and is in good condition but still was not as described and these little problems could have been avoided,neutral
i have a strange problem with this phone when it has  it is plugged into the wall some on screen buttons stop working,neutral
a phone this inexpensive does not need all the stuff that has  that is on it it makes the user interface too complicated better to keep it simple signal  sound quality was ok but it was just a temporary phone while my real one was being serviced ill keep it in the drawer as an emergency backup since ive spent more on bad lunches than this thing cost did the job i needed it to do,neutral
i got a ghz instead of a ghz announced,neutral
ok phone has lte and memory card slot if those were not there it had  it would be another just optimus,neutral
the construction is good and the fit and finish is quality i guess i may have got the wrong case for what i wanted the hole in the screen protector lets dust in under the screen and the speaker holes get full of junk as well the rubbery feel of the case makes it stick in your pocket which is just sort of expected for a heavier case i guess i work in very dusty farming conditions so ill have to see if i can find a full coverage case that is not so bulky and hard to get out of your pants,neutral
i had bought my son an i phone  and have had nothing but problems with it after  screen changes due to cracks i pledged never to spend any more money on i phones this was a reasonable alternative my son swore he would not use any phone but an i phone but it has been  months and so far and no complaints i have three of these phones,neutral
really like the design and capability of watch but battery life is terrible must keep recharging,neutral
i love the phone do not get me wrong but it was over advertised on its capabilities it is supposed be superfast because of its processor is better than ever but my phone has been sluggish ever since i got it it takes forever to open apps it freezes momentarily it takes a few seconds before it flips screen and when it updates it slows down bad my  year old phone that i replaced with this one is a lot faster but other than that it works,neutral
phone works fine but battery does not hold charge for long the phone has to be charged every day after a few months of use,neutral
this phone is excellent for the price the screen bright and clear colors it is amazing regarding i was specting something with cheap feeling but the reviews were rightmy only complaint is that when unboxing the phone i found that it was just the phone and the usb cable just that i understand about cutting manufacture costs but any phone should come with their wall charger and headphones at least cheap headphones i would probably gave five stars to this product if at least was clearly stated that the box includes only the phone and its usb cable,neutral
works for  weeks and then breaks weird ads pop up and i hate it,neutral
i bought around   went kaput screen went blank no reboot sent them to blumiami and no answer better choose blu studio selfie better and lower price,neutral
pretty good watch,neutral
the phone came on time  good but there should be a law that states that the amount of packaging that goes arround a product should not be too much i am sure we can leave a smaller carbon footprint by using smaller cartonsbad pointsthe phone is a basic phone ot too amny functions or capabalities to expand the phonegood pointsand very lightcheap,neutral
prior to buying i was not sure about the size it is basically the size of a gshock sports watchsoftware it is basically similar to nokia candy bar phones from around  there is a stylus built into the watch band that comes in handy as my big fingers would not be able to do much on the screen texting for most people this would not be a primary phone especially if you are a texter from my experience it is hard to switch between alpha and numeric because you end up having to scroll through a half dozen languages to get back around to alpha again bluetooth i successfully paired it with my car ford sync when it initially connects the car thinks it is in a call but that is easily cleared and worked fine from there somewhat successful with soundbeats universal hv which is a knock of of the lg it worked fine for handsfree which is the only real way to use this the speaker phone was not great i could not get the adp profile to work properly not  sure if that was an issue with the soundbeats or the watch but since the soundbeats streams audio fine from my samsung tab  i believe it is the watch mp player the software is very basic but functional i would have had to use the included earbuds since i could get the audio streaming to work over bluetooth succesfully read music from kingston  gb microsdhc class  flash memory card sdcgbetphone i use att and i had a smartphone that had the microsim i had to buy afunta nano sim adapter for iphone to convert it into a full size sim card it was a little tricky getting the sim into the phone using the adapter i probably spent a good  minutes i generally showed full bars call quality seemed decent i had a couple times when the audio was not great but i think that actually had to do with the other caller not this phonewatch the watch is accurate but it does reset when the battery is pulled probably the same if the battery fully diesthe screen blacks out unless you are using it so you have to touch a button to see the timebattery the battery is enough to make it at least a day and half on standby not sure about with excessive talking but that was with bluetooth turned onultimately i ended up returning it there were two factors that contributed the first was after cracking my screen on my smartphone i planned on dropping my data package to save month from the carrier i no more got the phone in and my carrier released new plans that covered data for the entire family talk for less that i was going to save by dropping just my data package so now there really is not a point in not having a smart phonei have a  tablet so i did not have to have a smart phone but it would have been hard for this to be a primary phone without something like that as i was using my tablet and google voice for texting which was the planif it was just the data plan issue i would have kept the watch phone simply for the mp player but since i cannot get the audio streaming to work reliably that is really what triggered me returning it instead of keeping itit was a cool little watch i work in it and it was cool little conversation starter i was so close to keeping it as a backup but just could not quite justify iti gave three starts because it was fun and i thought it was decent construction especially for the price my expectations were low based on other feedback but overall it worked but did have a few small issues that ended up being a deal breaker for me,neutral
purchased this item the phone works fine but i was expecting a frost blue phone but got a tacky sky blue insteadbig disappointment,neutral
this cell phone looks nice it has  it is very light good screen size for videos pictures etcsetup was very easy and migrating all all contacts from previous cell phone was a breezecamera app included is really bad terrible resolution even blurry pictures this phone is ok for the price for an android phone if you do not want a contract if you do not mind the contract go with a different phone perhaps an iphone a newer version of the samsung galaxy,neutral

at first i was excited to get this new smartphone inspite of the newness i am disappointed it seems there is limitedatbest product help available it seems as though this phone was someones afterthought and ditched it right away truth be told i would skip on this phone the next time and choose something a bit more in use it has  it is a good enough phone i suppose it has it has  it is flaws which for the most part can be overlooked considering the price it looks pretty but when blu gets it has  it is act together maybe they shall  they will make a better product,neutral

this phone is very slow want to navigate somewhere well it might take  minutes to load your directions it also sends and receives group messages from  very inconvenient because they come in at the bottom your message inbox it also broke after  months i would not buy this item again in fact i despite the money lost i am relived that it broke,neutral
it is big screen  but it is different with the one that i use before usa edition  i will not buy it again,neutral
i like many others who have written a review chose this phone because it is very cheap for a touch screen the first thing i like about the phone is that it is really really really light weight it has a good solid feel to the palm and will not suffer that much cosmetic damage the phone came with a screen protector so that was nice i did not want to spend more than a  dollars because all i do is text and call people with that said if you do not use internet or do not have a data plan then this is an okay phone if you do use a data plan do not even think about buying this phone it only uses the edge network and not g the phone came with a preinstalled firmware version kpatvf this firmware is pretty damn slow so i had to flash the phone to the vg version all the tutorials can be found on forums or youtube just search it with the new firmware the texting is x better and overall speed in navigating through folders is much better as well so update the firmware if you get this phone in addition a huge con is the amount of confirmation popups whenever you change something for instance trying to delete your text messages would follow this order delete selected  deleting  deleted that is really annoying and unnecessary the call quality is pretty good and it has  it is bluetooth ready the camera is okay when there is a lot of light if there is no light the image quality is similar to the sepia effect yeah its that bad overall i am satisfied with this phone due to the call quality and price but the biggest cons are definitely the initial firmware the processing speed and lackluster camera quality as for music it is loud but who really uses their phone for an mp player the phone also holds  total texts  in inbox and outbox more or less all in all if you do not want to be frustrated with the phones speed then update the firmware right when you get italso this phone is able to send and receive mms do not listen to other reviews you have to create new connection settings internet settings multimedia msg center settings and a new access point this information can be found onlinejust google it,neutral

i was super excited to see people selling this particular phone on amazon this was my first official nontracphone and i got it for my freshman year of college   it worked perfectly for me and i had it for about  years before i started experiencing problems with it it seemed like a cord was disconnected or something because it works while closed but stops working when i flip it up this was fine i just taped it shut but then i could not text or call numbers i did not already have in my contacts i read reviews about this phone and there seemed to be a lot of complaints about the charging part of it but i decided getting the phone i was familiar with was worth the risk long story short i ordered this phone was super excited that it was new and still in its box and put my old sim card in it this new phone does not charge the batteries i have used the charger it came with and  of my other chargers and it just does not charge it says it is charging but as soon as i unplug it it goes back to low batterie it is not the end of the world though i have been switching out the batteries and charging them with my old phone and then putting them back into the new one it is a bit of a hassle especially for long phone calls but it is worth it too me to have the phone i want i am sure when this one dies or i get sick of it i will probably upgrade to a better phone but for now i am happy with it  ,neutral
update so here is an essential list of important pros and conspros great cameras great feel in hand decent screen great pricecons camera app is a bit slow and stutters occasionally most importantly the sound quality is muffled and quiet on the phone this was supposed to be a present for my mom and she really likes the phone but nobody can understand what she while talking on the phone because the sound is so muffled unfortunately im going to have to return it because of that,neutral

phone is okay very small compared to my old phone the major thing is the seller included a note that if you let the battery run down completely on this model that the charger will not work you then need an external charger which we had to order within the first week it is inconvenient to make sure you watch so the battery stays charged other than that not a bad phone especially if you want a basic phone to avoid data charge of  a month from verizon verizon sure is pushing everyone to use a smart phone,neutral

this phone works it has  it is not awesome but it has  it is fine for texting calling camera and navigation which is pretty much all i use it for anyway so it has  it is perfect for me there is a strip at the top of the phone i got where the touch screen will not work but it has  it is not that big of a deal for me to send it back and have it replaced it has  it is just mildly annoying  it does not let the notifications bar come down but it does not affect how the phone actually works at all it has  it is a little slow and the battery life is on the short end of average but i may be biased about battery life since my last phone was a droid razr maxx and the battery would last for a week without charging so all in all good cheap phone if you need a quick replacement but i would not buy it as my new phone that i intend to keep long term,neutral

these are not  am not at all what i expected i think the description did include the size but they are gigantic and made of hard plastic i was expecting something smaller and of a softer lighter material like silicone so i could keep one in my purse but they are too big for that they do work as intended but it has  it is overkill for even a large phone galaxy note would probably work with a tablet though,neutral

it is in no fashion a bad phone ive owned a blu phone prior to this and moved to this phone because of it has  it is additional cores and higher resolution camera in comparison to the old phonepros good screen  it has  it is not going to blow your mind or anything but it has  it is a solid screenthe look i like the look of it i feel it has  it is very sleekconsthe home bar  it has  it is moody after three months i still cannot determine if the home bar needs an aggressive knuckle bending poke or the daintiest of taps additionally the home bar is backlit and while that is very neat looking it has  it is also deeply impractical when combined with a moody home bar because the icons completely disappearthe bumper case  the case itself is fine i received a frosted white case which made the phone look filthy the instant it was applied i do not use this case i hated my phone looking dirty and it kinda ruined the shape and feel of the phone for meweird behavior  if the battery gets low enough that the phone legitimately dies it might not turn back on shortly after being connected to a power source or within the hour ive experienced this three times as of nowthis phone is perfectly fine but i would not recommend anyone purchase this specific model it looks nice and functions well but the home bar issue is annoying enough for me to miss my old blu phone i still think blu is a good company and are capable of producing a great product but this one was a bit off,neutral

this is my first droid phone and a big difference from my windows phone i prefer the windows live tile format but like that the droid has access to more apps this phone will not allow you to sync a yahoo email account while on a wifi connection which really sucks imo it has  it is because they want to force you into gmail it also keeps vibrating and lighting up for alerts but i cannot ever seem to find what it has  it is alerting me to there are no new messages which is all i really care to be alerted for the packaging says that a micro sd memory card is included but it is not and you will need to purchase and install in order to take photos on your phone the phone was super easy to set up on the verizon network and did automatically import all of the contacts id backed up on my old phone,neutral

ive had this watch for a few days now it synced to my android just fine downloaded the app for phone with the qr code fit is comfortable i have small wrists and it is not so huge it bothers me do not notice it really all notifications work well when i get a notification it plays my phone ringtone so both this and my phone are babbling minions till i check it the sleep monitor works fine only tried that once so idk how true but for last night being as i did not sleep it said poor seems right the pedometer works well but is a little slow takes a few to catch up texts messages come threw fine and you can reply to them phone calls come threw but i have not been able to talk on it due to interference with something else in my home possibly other bluetooth devices interfering browser remote capture image viewer and audio player i cannot get to function ive sent an email to the company due to this not really having instructions there was some but did not have much info so overall this is a good starter watch for someone wanting to try a smart watch which is why i bought it it works ok for the price will add more on email reply from company,neutral
judging from other comments there seem to be variations in the cell phones received the one i bought came with a very thin charging cable ending in a permanentlyattached electrical plug which obviously will not connect with a computer or work for data transfer while i do not have any current need for this id like to have the option and since models described on the samsung site clearly come with a charge cable that does work for data transfer i think the product description ought to mention that this one does notalso the phone i received had a settings issue that made it impossible to connect to wifi until i was able to get telephone assistance of a us samsung techie who spent over an hour on the phone with me figuring out what was wrong and finally solved the problem by helping me do a factory data reset after which it did connect without difficulty i had already lost time trying to call the number included with the phone shipped to me in a rather ominous sticker that you have to tear through to open the box saying any problem call us first returning phone first settingsback  resetfactory reset save unnecessary fees  time sic  and though i called the number during the times listed i only reached a recording saying that the magic jack number was currently not in serviceid already tried following the instructions on the tiny setup guide inside the box but aside from saying there is a setup process to be followed the first time you turn on the phone its referring users to an instruction manual accessed through the phones settings only generated more frustration since you need a wifi connection to access the manualhaving gotten walked through the reset process by the us samsung techie i can now see that the sticker must be supposed to alert buyers to this issue but though im a pretty careful reader of instructions i was too wary of getting into something as majorsounding as a factory reset without some techsavvy assistancethough this phone finally does seem to have turned out to be an economicallypriced option that is now working fine it took some hours of frustration to get there i do not know if all the phones shipped will require doing a reset before they will work but judging from that sticker this is at least a fairly common situation that potential buyers should be informed about in advance and clearer instructions should definitely be included with the phone,neutral
can not believe how easily this screen scratches for such a beautiful display it has  it is a waste of technology in my opinion,neutral
this phone will work for people who are basic smartphone users ig fb whatsapp email calls and texti am a more advanced user so i was happy with this phone for about  months after that ive been forced to delete and disable apps in order to get new ones in im a frequent user of netflix and spotify but had to uninstall spotify because although i do not have any tracks saved it kept telling me the memory was fullthe phone has never told me who has  who is calling i have to guess and it has  it is sloooooow to do even the most basic thing like switching from an app to another at some point it started rebooting itself but that went away on its ownsometimes the keyboard stops responding and just after a year of use the charger has completely diedthe only reason why i have not changed it yet is because i need a much better phone but im unable to afford it after  year of terrible quality im definitely ready for an upgrade,neutral

i bought this phone primarily because of the battery capacity and in that regard it has met all my expectations the dualsim feature was also welcome although i have not made use of ithowever i have had repeated and multiple software related problems apps would stop working giving the message unfortunately name of app has stopped i have done no less than  resets in less than  months and have had to make  or  trips to my carrierowned stores for help i did not know about rootednonrooted phones and the possible related issues but i would not have allowed that to become an issue for me however having the whole phone freeze about  times and apps i need to work freeze xwk killed the deal it did that to me for the last time last night and im done when it restarts app icons move or disappear on their own i still liked that its a slim pocketfitting phone despite the screen size and the battery because of which i bought it has never disappointed me thats why it doesnt get a  star still it has got to work to work fo me this was my first disappointing blu experiment,neutral

my son wanted a watch so i researched all over amazons choices this watch seemed to be excellent it came in i did not even open it just gave it to my son excited he has  he is  and a tech junkie he took one look at it and tossed it aside he has  he is about  feet tall and a big guy so it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him he said the watch face itself is much too huge too thick too big for him to wear he did not like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it altogether and was not interested in it any further he left on the table beside him and did not give it a second look even though i advised him all it could do nope not even remotely interested because it was too big i tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him ive still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago im keeping it though hoping that one day it will be useful to me im thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes but i really cannot speak up on it i have not used it no one wants to wear such a thick faced watch so the technical features have not yet been experienced so if i do take the time to find someone to use it i will be sure to update you on that the three stars is only that no one wants to wear it,neutral
it was not unlocked for the caribbean even though it stated international i am not please it is costing more to have it unlocked,neutral
the phone itself is a nice phone honestly i knew there were not as many apps for windows as there are for android and that was finewhat i was not prepared for was just how outdated and bad the apps were i am regretting this purchase not because the phone is bad but just because of the lack of up to date apps if you are not much of an app user this phone would be great if you like your apps to be up to date and useable then stick with android or even iphone,neutral
nice phone but to delicate for me i already broke it,neutral

for the price this watch is awesome i am looking to upgrade to a samsung gear soon so this was a starter watch to see what it is like to be able to check messages without having my phone in my hand you cannot set themes to this watch so if you are big on personalizing then this may not be the watch your looking formove along,neutral
im a patient tech savvy guy so after my rd factory reset and a continued glitchy system i have given up im giving it  stars still because i see the potential and it seems other users have had a great experience i do not wanna scare you off from giving this a go maybe i just got an unlucky pick off the line definitely potential but definitely a pain in my butt gonna try out the oneplus one instead,neutral
this is a good phone for a kid the specific phone worked well although it came with a dead battery i happened to have another battery handy so i used it rather than requesting a replacement from the company that sold the phone in any event the phone has worked properly since i received it,neutral
i purchased my device from breed ive owned the original phone brand new this is just a replacement and this does not feel the same the shape of the phone is  similar but the one i got was a rough cut and lost some of the quality and detail that it should have the body and sides of the original had a nice rubbery grip feel to them the one i got was pure plastic this would make the phone really slippery and for a phone this big that has  that is not good i guess i can understand now why it was offered at a price like this you can really tell the difference but at least the software is still the same i would not recommend unless you really like the s active but you need to save some money i cannot tell if its a cheap knock off because it registers with samsung accounts online and has a proper imei number the phone works well it just feels like a lower quality device than the one i bought from the store,neutral
thought this came with a camera was disspointed but works ok,neutral
nice little toy with the functions you can expect from this sizeprice phone functions work ok bearing in mind that the display is very little what else can you expect from this size and it is well finished but the micro is crap  communication it almost impossible and due to this the entire phone is with very limited use too bad hope that the next edition will have a better quality microphone,neutral

there are currently four nonembedded sim formats this phone uses the microsim ff introduced in  which measures mm long x mm wide x mm thick for those who may have encountered the same oversight there are articles available on how to trim down a larger format if you are brave enough to seek out the guidance it is possible you have the manual dexterity and proper tools to safely accomplish the task,neutral

unlocked quadband s smart watch phone support camera tf card micro sd card sim card bluetooth wrist smartwatchok let us start off with the good for the price point this watch feels and looks pretty high end the screen is super responsive and the ui is a bit tricky but after  minutes i was all good with it charge time was decent i went from  to full in under an hour battery life under normal use notifications bluetooth connection occasional time checking and steps was ok full day and it was down to about  so expect close to  days of usage from this watchthe bad this is android compatible not android wear so there is no way to get google apps on this watch you are stuck with whatever apps already come with the watch earpiece is the usb headphones so you cannot use any standard mm headset with the watch i have beats and it will not work with it even though the screen is responsive the apps are not really good and not friendly to usethis watch is an ok experiment but if you are looking for android wear device this is not it,neutral

really nice phone but no carrier and i could not find one that would use the phone and that has  that is kind of sad because it really was a nice phone,neutral
it has  it is ok for the price its decent it has  it is definitely slow at times and has really low inear volume and the speaker for playing music out loud is not anything to write home about either the battery is not all that great to be honest i have to admit that for the price it has  it is good but if you want a good phone maybe one of their more highend products will suit you better it is packaged with a case and screen protector which i thought was a nice touch but this phone is nothing spectacular it sucks that it has  it is slow out the box ,neutral
beautiful phoneand great performancethis phone handles all i could throw at it so farim a game freak and for me a phone ought to be able to handle games like asphalt  in full graphic settings with no problemso far no problemthe game loads very fast and very smoothlya few slow drop frames ever so oftenthe screen is a beauty to watchto answer some questions that i know some may have there are not  am not any led notification lights to me that has  that is minoralthough that would have added to its flare considering the size of the bezel on top of the  gb  is available for storage and it easily increases via micro sdi am using a  gb samsung micro sdhc card and there were no problems in its recognition by the deviceive selected the option of using the micro sd as default storage but i noticed that certain apps cannot help but be installed in some way on the internal memory of the phoneas a result a little more of the internal memory will be usedbut only a littlebefore that i had an atrix  with  gb of rated internal memoryabout  gb of actual memory and i could not as an option install apps to the sd without rooting the phoneeven then it was problematicbut the gigs i had were more than enough still for several large games at the same time like asphalt  and  modern combat  and the likeso far ive been able to install asphalt  on the cardthe whole of itdecided to redownload some others as wellso i do not expect any storage problems unless i try to download and install more than  large apps it is very efficient on ram with no bloatware i had over fourteen apps open at the same time including asphalt  netflix facebook and almost half of the ram still available when i checked makes me wonder what would have happened if they gave this  gigs of ram as i know some people suggestedthe  gig so far is more than enoughi suspect the  cores are making ram usage much more efficient of the two sims one is mini regular sized sim and the other is micro sizedthey were very easy to install and once both sims are installed you get the option of making one sim your default for calls texts or data each separately sim  can be used for calls only if you desire while sim  could be used for the other aspects sim  is the micro simadditionally i do not know if it has  it is just me but the battery seemed to drain a little faster when only one sim was installedi have not really investigated further so not surejust something to keep in mind android  has been dished outseems to have come out on the th of the monthwas skeptical to upgrade since no announcement was made on blus facebook page or even the website was down for some timebut i decided to try itit has  it is officialjust had to be patient during the upgrade process and not interrupt in any wayso far the phone feels much more fluid than beforenothing extra special noticed as yetof course ill be playing around with it some the battery life is acceptable at best i think this is to me the thing i like the least about this phone in standby the battery will last mind you but once you are using it to let us say instant message via whatsapp and facebook with a little gaming and music inbetween you shall  you will get around    hoursthat has  that is what ive seen so farsince it has  it is an core processor with mediatek i was expecting stellar battery lifebut screen on time has not impressed me much in as much as it is limited to within  hours instead of within  hoursthey could have done alot better with the batteryhopefully the update will make better use of battery or maybe they could create a better  mah or perhaps a larger mah  mah battery to fit the phonestill consider the priceit is better or as good as many other devices out there at the same price the speaker is very clear and cleanloud enough too for my liking and the phone itself comes with a beautiful music player that offers several sound effects like plate reverb large room etc along with different play modes like classical dance hip hop pop etci said before that i do not feel the desire to get another player from google play store but i redownloaded fusion music player which allows users to cut a song at any point to make a desired ringtoneit also allows online content and other useful features sowith respect to the speakers though i do think that they probably could have placed it at the front considering how much bezel that is present below the capacitive buttons or they could have placed a smaller one therebut it works well on the back nonethelesslean it onto something solid when playing videos and the sound resounds beautifully the wifi antennae seems pretty strongi was travelling around with this and it has  it is been picking up wifi signals from homes as i passed by with more than a few barsit connected to my home wifi very quickly call quality is very goodi only made a few short calls so far but individuals hear me clearly and they sound clearly also with no background noise and no drop callsso far so good there is a setting that allows me to suppress my background noise during calls too both cameras function well and take clear picturesthe flash on the back is bright enough to take good pictures at nightthe interface is minimalistic and cleanone issue is that whenever the video icon is touched the camera automatically starts recording videodo not know if i can change this in the settings yet but ill keep looking into it i have not tried out the bluetooth as yet so i cannot say how stable it is in use yet the headphones are not  am not so specialdo not expect to experience the best sounds from them but they are good enough and come with a mic something i noticed is that when using the screen for typing i sometimes have to press the same area  times or wait for a second or two to get a letter outi went into audio settings and disabled the vibration feedback and it helped a little but it still happens though less frequentlyit has  it is therefore one of two things i it has  it is a software problem which can be fixed with the update or ii my particular phone has a minor faultstill this does not take away from the usability of the phone since it only happens ever so often and lasts for  seconds i ran antutu benchmark several times and the highest score i ever got was ram usage is great and shows up better than most phones in comparison  vs  on the galaxy s it may take some time to get used to the position of the capacitive buttonstheir background light goes off after only a few seconds without interaction and i sometimes had to search a bit for themin a well lit area there is not a problem seeing them without their background light oni think that we should be allowed to change how long they light up for thoughhopefully that is included in the updateallinall this phone worksand there is no need to pay  us dollars on a brand phone like samsung or htc when you have blu coming through with so much to offer at an acceptable pricecompared to the moto g at the same price you get alot more value for moneyupdatedec ive been using the phone for a few months with minor issues until now im finally in a position to really try the bluetooth but so far im very disappointed ive tried it with several bluetooth devices and am yet to get a stable connectionthat sucks since i really use bluetooth of recent including my computer which works just fine with the bluetooth usb device i ordered from inateck other than the bluetooth another issue i think needs be resolved is the lack of ability to make the power button a camera snapper and the pictures are amazing btwsometimes it has  it is hard to snap oneself having to search for the exact point on the screen to touch with ones fingerin addition it seems to change settings every now and then with regards to my music ringtones though i suspect my music app may have something to do with that the ringtone i use changes on its own for whatever reasoni hope blu resolves all these issues because with all these things i do not think this phone is worth the  they are asking for especially considering that other phones in their lineup are cheaper without these issues so im bringing down my rating to a  until i see reason to do otherwise,neutral

i got this phone a few months ago because ive started using google docs and the screen on my previous phone comet was too small to use it comfortably im happy with the screen on the phone it has  it is fast enough to play some games angry birds is laggy on most levels but playable i have the kindle app and find it has  it is comfortable to read on as well if i do not have my kindle on methings i do not like about the phone there is no alertnotification led this is the biggest deficiency have to activate the screen to see if i have any notifications there is no autoadjust option for screen brightness the phone beeps or vibrates when on vibrate when it has  it is fully charged who ever thought it would be a good idea to have your phone wake you up in the middle of the night when it has  it is charged phone has a lot of bloat ware i really need to get around to rooting and deleting the stuff that has  that is not needed a minor annoyance but it has  it is difficult to tell which end of the phone is which by feel and the volume button is on the opposite side as the power button so i find myself often pressing the volume by mistake when i want to hit the power button i was not able to get tethering to work not sure if it has  it is my plan or something else but can tether on my old phone with the same sim card no ice cream sandwichthings i like about the phone memory is more than adequate for my needs ill need to add a microsd card eventually but have not needed to yet screen size and quality it has  it is adequately fast it has  it is cheap camera has a flash g hspaim still happy i got this phone since im rather frugal and i would not want to spend twice as much money to get a phone that only takes care of a few more of my disappointments,neutral

the shipping was rather quick though i did pay extra for expedited it came in a padded envelope rather than a box and without the iphone box itself which i do not understand as the item is listed as brand new in addition with a charger stuffed in there both the cable and solid wall charger which could have ended up badly a bit more caution should have been taken in my opinion the listing also said accessories which was false as the headphone that come with the phone were not included costing me another  after tax however when i received the phone all things seem in working order and had no issue activating it with my verizon carrier so far it seems to be in flawless condition visually and operationally i shall update if anything happens with in all and all i am happy with my purchase and will consider buying from this seller again,neutral
the phone itself is okay it has just enough storage for  personal apps i use cannot download anything else,neutral
i have had numerous issues with this iphone  but after hours on the phone on several separate occasions with apple technicians i believe most of the issues have finally been resolved the primary problem was that the software needed to be updated based on my experience i hope in the future if i ever need to replace my phone that i will be in a financial position to purchase a new rather than a refurbished one at this point i had no choice the cost was a  less than a new phone so i was happy to be able to replace my iphone  which finally went dead at a reasonable cost,neutral

the phone has a nice big display unfortunately the display is only average the colors and accuracy do not seem as good as my old galaxy  after spending a couple months with this phone i have found several annoyances it randomly shuts down while in use and this is not a product of low battery it has been happening less lately i hate the position of the volume controls and power button but that has  that is just personal preference i wish the software would let me turn off txt and game notifications but allow calls to come thru at normal volume the phone is a bit laggy you especially notice this when trying a voice search on google i constantly have trouble with the txt keyboard it likes to add a word smooshed onto the end of my last word no dedicated contacts icon is another annoyance that could be easily fixed i am happy with the battery life and the camera is better than id expected the volume level from the speaker is quite good it has  it is a decent midrange phone that has a removable memory card which is important to me,neutral
i bought this and switched from my broken droid in hopes of being impressed one last time by blackberry needless to say i was not its only g which is not all bad but the speeds are horrendous the camera is crap it lags with almost every somewhat easy task and will sit and pinwheel all day there were some pros however the battery was god like the design and feel was beautiful and i almost always got solid bes and g signal yeah its still blackberry  so the apps were not there but as long as you are an adult about what has  what is truely important to you as far as apps go you can manage there is pandora basically all the biggies are there it was a nobile effort blackberry but seriously give it up with ,neutral
this dual sim phone works as advertised it is a low cost option for a good phone that functions on gsm networks everywhere ive taken it so far it uses full size sim cards so no questionable cutting involved as many foreign countries do not yet widely sell micro or nano chips such as central america and eastern europe allows for easy sms on either sim and options to allow messaging from one service while on a call using the other sim servicethis phone is slow do not buy if you are hoping to get a powerhouse of a phone apps run slow gps can lag and on occasion it will freeze it does allow you to stay informed on the network if communication is vital while traveling email facebook and other social and information apps such as bloomburg and news apps work normally albeit a little slowworks with movistar and claro in nicaragua life in ukraine as well as networks in honduras venezuela brazil mexico romania russia poland and moldova not a g phone,neutral

not as cool as i thought only calls n texts must have a sd card to work right,neutral
i did not really like it but before i get into it i will say that the two things i did enjoy were the overall handsome sturdy look and feel of the phone and the vivid brightness of the screen which was easy on the eyes and battery life even with the night filter app running other than that the camera was okthe thing i found myself getting very annoyed at was having to tap an icon or option more than once just to activate it for example i had google maps and several other apps open there was no lag at all but when i hit the recent apps key to get rid of a few apps i had to tap that a couple of times some of the apps i tried to swipe away would open because the screen was not as responsive to my quick touch another example was in the phone settings when tapping on the categories a firmer touch than what im used to was required to get to the next screencompared to the blu studio super camera ive been using for the past couple of months which is pretty fast and responsive the c seems lethargic it definitely has some touch factor issues the phone is not buggy rather it has  it is just quite cumbersome when it comes to standard touch operations like scrolling and selectingi guess what i thought might be a slightly better device than my fast super camera turned out to have more of an entrylevel feel to it even though it looked nice and felt sturdy in my hand it was actually quite dull and sluggish,neutral
needs some sort of app to connect messages and email instructions are not clear downloaded a few apps from play store none of them seemed to do the trick,neutral
i cannot fairly review as it only worked for me about  days no sooner than i got halfway used to using it i rolled over on it with a socket in my pocket broke the screen and now it only shows a bunch of lines cannot say anything bad since that was my fault however i have done lots of stuff without breaking the old phone i kept in the same pocket but it had a smaller screen i got used to doing without some of the features of my old phone but loved the camera which took great pictures,neutral
for the price it is a pretty good phone it seems slow to me compared to the galaxy siii i used to have but it is not too bad the picture quality especially does not compare favorably but then what do you expect from a phone that costs less than  it does most everything i need to do with a phone the most annoying thing about it so far is that i cannot find a way to turn the notification alerts for text and email messages off while leaving the ringtone for calls on i need to be able to get emergency alerts at night but i do not want to wake up for every notification for that reason i may have to switch phones it is a good product if you just cannot afford to buy asamsung or an iphone,neutral

the phone came in a little white coffin of a box inside the amazon package the tiny box was scotch taped shut and the phone itself was in a plastic sleeve with a sticker covering the screen for safetythe phone itself appeared like new it came with an oem battery installed a working s pen and a rapid charger and cable the phone itself worked fine nfc heart rate scanner cameras flash speakers and mic did the jobthe phone really was like new except for the screen it had definitely been replaced at some point or potentially needed to be it was unscratched but there was a flicker like an old tv with bad signal and it was only worsened when the auto feature for screen brightness was on otherwise it was a constant dull rolling in the background the only time you couldnt see the lines were when it was on full brightnessit made me worried that the screen might go out ive set up to return it after only having it a few hours,neutral
the phone itself is okay but problematic coveragewise on the tmobile network you are better off finding an unlocked tmobile version of the phone such as the zs which i now have and love if your carrier is tmobileafter about a year or so having the phone it would autoshut off and oni believe a lot of it had to do with glitches in the last update on it,neutral

update  i am returning my blu phone for reasons listed in the bad part of my review also uploaded pictures of performance testing and error messagesupdate  blu has been promising an android kitkat software update for months and have missed every deadline they set today i read an interview on androidguys where the ceo samuel ohevzion said that if you want the latest operating system that they had promised you should sell your old phone and buy a new one with that software i think that is horrible servicegoodits decently priced and has a big bright display it does offer dual sims although they do not really work supports multiple gsm frequencies of  mhz and hsdpa  mhzmediocrei bought this phone because i was impressed with its specs when i started using it i noticed it lagged anywhere it needed graphics even simple video games with d graphics would freeze i downloaded antutu which is an app that tests all aspects of the phone and tried it outi was really surprised to find that the blu life one x was slower than a nexus  and even slower than a samsung galaxy  basically the blue one x has better hardware but the older phones work much better i did some research and found out its because blu uses cheap memory which perform horribly the ram where android operating system runs and flash storage where pics and apps are stored run about the same speed as phones that came out  years agobadoccasionally when i try to make calls i get a message that says call not sent no valid number entered and i have to try  or  times before it will dial throughthe gps only works about  of the time and often takes several minutes to lock doing a side by side comparison with google maps and waze using the blue one x a samsung galaxy  and a nexus  the blue one x was always the last phone to lock into gps and find streets correct it often took twice as long as the other phonesanother issue is that blu uses a different address book and dialer than the standard android os this causes it not to sync well with things like google voice or google address book or viberdual sims i have multiple sims cards so i tried out the dual sim feature tmobile in the  slot and att in the number  slot so far i have not been able to dial out at all using att when both slots are full if att is the only sim in the phone works fine put tmobile back in and no matter what i try i cannot make calls using attdata through the dual sims is a bit of a hassle it takes nine clicks to switch between data services and then you have to wait about  for the transfer to completelastly even though blu promised an android update months ago this phone is still running android  blus ceo was quoted in an interview that if people want the newest version of android they should buy a new phonesummary do not buy this phone for the dual sim that feature does not work blu has not updated the phone once as promised and likely will not provide regular updates the specs are misleading and this phone performs poorly if you want an inexpensive phone that performs well and gets regular updates there are many better choices used samsung galaxy  or nexus  both cost less and are faster work better have newer versions of android,neutral

this device is good to have for a period of approximately a week any individual with a modern device ie samsung note series galaxy nexus etc will be able to make due until their device is replaced or the time comes where you can purchase a device of your choice to have this device permanently is definitely not recommended after a weeks period has lapsed the phone apparently cannot manage it has  it is own internal memoryram very well oem applications such as the camera gallery browser and texting will all begin to lag heavily or freeze if you are a heavy user such as myself this phone will not be able to keep up to have this device in a drawer in the event you break a screen and are in need of your primary services data phone text this phone will serve those purposes but with a caveat slow or laggy transitions between apps poor quality in phone audio and a screen interface that will not dim or shut off when you put the device to your ear in which the end result is prematurely ending calls pausing calls or placing the phone on speaker which utilizes the earphone speaker and blasts you with approximately a volume increase with out warningagain this device is good for what it is for the value the screen is a  out of  when compared to my note  and sedge k screens and it says a lot considering its a in display the battery will last a heavy user a day and the beginning of a morningi get up at about a check email immediately text staff and im usually through  conversations by a min each web browse for about hr during the day and text throughout my day ends at about pm with  left and that will be run down on youtubefor a spare device or a travel device it will do great if you are a big camera person this device will most likely not suit your needs,neutral

well  i had this phone for about  months now and at first the phone was great no straches just like new but after  months of having the phone my memory started to get full i could have only  pictures and it would get full so i could not take any photos or if i did i had to delete my current ones which been really annoying and i do not know if it has  it is the phone because it has  it is a used phone or if it has  it is metro pcs but im always getting drop calls and the phone freezes up   sometimes it takes forever to come up on after restarting it  the phone was a gb which that was my fault but over all i thought it would have thought it would had performed a lot better,neutral

granted i bought this phone in used acceptable form as a standin while my regular phone got repaired but i wish i had known that the rating meant gps would not work right a dead touch zone on the screen i was able to turn the phone sideways in some instances so i could use a live portion of the screen to tap something and that the camera was not only the usual htc purple tint but that it would not focus at all even in bright light but it did take phone calls and the data worked which was handy while i waited for htc to finish repairing my regular htc one so yeah i guess i got what i paid for a used mostly acceptable phone just please detail what does not work so when we buy these things we at least know what to expect and do not get any recurring disappointing surprises it would not have been as bad had i known not to rely on the gps ahead of time or had i known the camera was shot but i probably would not have bought it had i known of the dead area on the screen so three stars not a terrible experience but boy was i glad to get my repaired phone back maybe there should be a section for what does and does not work on these used phones,neutral

i gave up my iphone for something simpler i have a number of lines so i still have smart phones small and light it comes with a european two prong plug which then is paired to an adapter also you cannot change the image on the home screen so i hope you like flowers i cannot complain for what i paid,neutral
was not what i was expecting,neutral
nice phone but the camera has poor pic quality,neutral
this note  works okay with cricket wireless but only includes three of the five band that cricket uses also cricket said that it was an european phone instead of a usa phone and that was why it did not contain all of the five frequency bands used by cricket we were tokd that the phone should work okay but would not work as efficiently as a usa phone and may not be able to receive as strong a signal as a phone with all five of the frequency bands that work with cricket wireless so far it has worked okay except when we were in the dominican republic on vacation last week it would not allow messaging at all so good uck if you purchased this cell phone from this vendor,neutral
this phone regularly drops reception unless in direct line to a tower and even then will drop to x for no obvious reason also the screen has developed a glitch where the bottom half takes on a scratchy digital distortion right before the screen fades out and whenever you wake it back up does not affect the function but increases my uneasy feeling about how much worse it will get also the fingerprint reader in the home button was a neat thought but it needs tweaking it rarely accepted my scan in less than three attempts still a samsung galaxy though and remains my favorite line of phones screen is beautiful and the ui is logical speaker volume is great and the body fit has  it is nicely into my hand,neutral
this phone would be perfect if it was not for the battery life with moderatehigh use im lucky if it lasts  hours,neutral
worked great for a long time but then it would not update and i reset it and it would not download my apps or send pictures or screenshot pay the extra  for a note ii it has  it is worth it,neutral
super neat phone however i have a few issues with this phonefirst it did not accept my old  gb micro card i had to buy another card and start all over again then although you set phone to allow apps vids etc to go to sd card its not storing there you have to go to settings and manually move apps from phone to sd card which is slow i purchased this phone mainly for the sd card but its not as i expected i had to go through a long process in re transferring stuff onto new card and worst yet its not storing stuff onto sd card it keeps using phone memory as default,neutral
i love note  and nothing to complain about itthe note  i received is not samsung factory unlocked instead it was a device made for orangefrance orange is a mobile network like att here in us which is unlocked the device started in french and i had to trip it to english inside it had many orange network apps which i did not wanted i could not delete many of themi would have given a  star rating since the description of this product did not say anything about orangefrance and it was a waste of my time in this order also i beard the postal cost to return it backbut i gave  stars only because of the cooperation this store provided to ease the return process they have refunded my money promptlybut i still recommend if you are okay getting a orange network phone after all the phone was good just that i did not like it as it had inbuilt apps which may not bother others,neutral
this phone is part of a way  phablet showdown which includes the following devices sony xperia z ultra  sony t ultra  lg g vista  zte zmax  blu studio  lte and the winner isnot the blu studio  lte not by a longshotsorry blu in my opinion this is another wasted opportunity to show that your company can be relevantit has  it is not all bad but it has  it is not good enough eitherpros the  x screenit is big it has a very sharp picture with deep colors and it has  it is just plain beautiful the build quality is as good as any phone on the marketwith its antislip back and rounded corners this phone just fits my hand and feels good the buttons are well placed and they have a great feel even through the tpu rubber case with the capacitive buttons below the screen it allows the usable area of the screen to be just that much bigger some people do not like the capacitive buttons but i prefer them gb of on board storageexcellent storage for a midrange phone it can use an sd card up to gbcompared to  gb for many others in this segment apps can be moved to the sd card to further expand storagenot all manufacturers get this sony phones require a software update to make this work and the zte does not get it at all lg gets it right out the boxthe camera takes ok pictures and is responsivealthough it has  it is a little difficult to useso it does not have the wizbang features of the sony but the picture quality produced by this mp is much better than the mp on sony t ultra it far outweighs the mp offerings on the other  phones in this test as well it has an impressive antutu benchmark score of approx higher speed processor and gb of ram help this phone rule the benchmark score only the z ultra with it has  it is really fast processor and gb ram scored better the screen covers an impressive  of the surface area of the phone this is on par with the best of  in the box accessoriesjust like the high end units available today this phone comes with a wired headset and exclusive to blu the box also contains a tpu rubber case and  screen protectors are included in the box at least  value based on amazon prices some would argue that blu has to do this because you cannot buy aftermarket cases and screen protectors for their phones this may be true at least for a while after launch and this phone is brand new as of december th i believe historically though blu phones do not get a lot of attention from aftermarket accessory companies to be fair the lg g vista and the zte zmax will probably never get a lot of aftermarket accessories as wellconsit does not operate very smoothlypaging from one homescreen to another should be a lot more fluid pulling down the notifications should not feel notchy apps should open more smoothly and they do when you use any of a number of launchers available on the play store i had my best results with the nova launcher paid edition for  but the free version was ok too this tells me that a software update may fix this phones biggest downside and and it appears that blu has made provisions for that with the wireless update link under the about device menu in settings i could be wrong but i do not remember the blu studio  hd having a similar update linkbluetooth vthe specs for this phone are hard to find but when you do find them they show that it only supports blutooth v  that means it will not work with smart watches and most fitness trackers lowenergy blutooth v has been out for a very long time the blu studio  hd even had bt i hope this is simply a mistake in the marketing material if not this is a tragedyit does not have very many lte radiosit does have the right radios band on aws for tmobile but it does not have the right radios band on mhz for tmobiles upcoming high speed lte it also does not have the correct radios for lte service in most other countries or on att in the us not cool blu again i hope that these stats are misquoted but i do not think they areno aftermarket development community that i could findroot and roms may never be developed for this phone aftermarket accessories may not ever be made for this phoneit would look really sexy in a terrapin ultra slim flip case like the one available for the xperia z ultra will they ever make one that fits this phone probably not the specs do not indicate gorilla glassother blu phones do have it so if this is their flagship i expect it here because it does not have it finally blu tech support is hard to get in touch with both on the phone and via email and they do not respond to email within their  day promisei have asked tech support for info about upcoming fixes and spec clarification bt but blu has yet to respondwith all these shortcomings this phone offers a good value in the sub  phablet arena but it has  it is far from the best value avoid the frustation and anxiety you get wishing this phone was better and hoping for fix from blu that will probably never comebuy last years flagship on amazon without a warranty you will be glad you did,neutral
this phone is okbut no boomsound front facing speakers so the terribly places speaker grill will be covered by your pinky finger while holding with one hand which will muffle the already disappointingly low volume the volume sucks it has boomsound but only when done headphones are plugged in the screen is nice everything else is solid the camera is improved over the m but the m is overall a better phone this phone is ok if u want an android in an iphones body,neutral
it sometimes lag that is what i do not like,neutral

after quite some time that ive had this watch all i can say is that you get what you pay for so not too bad  of course there are much better smart watches but if you are considering this one it has  it is because you are on a certain budget limit syncs fine and battery life is not bad  touch is not going to be the most fluid but it has  it is not the worst eithernot too bulky and looks professional,neutral
good phone but easy to break screenthis thing is also full of adswhich burns up your data plani wish there was a way to kill the adsi think it is part of the interfacei had to reset it about every two weeksthe ads eat up your memory on your phone tonice phone just to many flaws in it,neutral
ive been using this for two years now and i can review with some much certainty overall it is a good product two sim cards is useful and not much problem basic features work well including camera voice recorder calls in and out what i had problem with is activating internet on this thing somehow it does not work out even near a wifi the internet connection is not so great sometimes it gets slow or freezes for  sec and then works normally again it lasted this long battery life is good i have dropped it a couple of times so no big deal it is great for basic use but do not look for great graphics or serious internet use,neutral
the only major problem ive had with this phone is that it freezes and sometimes it can be a pain to restart it then it takes a while for it to load all your data once you turn it back on besides that it has  it is good not the best phone ever if you text and surf the web a lot like i do and do not have a big budget for a smart phone it has  it is a good phone,neutral

i should have checked this out before purchasing it was purchased for a  spunky lady but has some difficulty recalling long instructions we sent up voice dial but there were many commands to get to it you could not set voice dial as default to come up first another thing when the you voice dial the phone ask it that who you really want to call you have to wait for a beep before saying yes the beep is very faint and no way an older person could hear it so that makes the voice dial feature not easy to use the phone is similar to most flip phones but does has larger numbers in which to seethis phone came was free shipping but we paid extra to have it delivered by a certain day it was not delivered until after our deadline,neutral

bought for my son for christmas with the intention of using att i took it to the att store and they checked it all out and said it would work only for phone calls and texting but not for data because the firmware in the phone that has the settings for data that works with att was outdated and would not work on their system i looked at the blu website and they tell you how to update to the latest android version on some of their phones but i see no way to upgrade the firmware that corresponds to all the phone carrier settings that would make it active on a sim card the phone itself is nice and my son really likes it so far and i did get him a pay as you go phone and text plan from att but no data yes i suppose i could send it back to try to get an updated phone but he has been using it for at about a week right after christmas before i took it to att and does not want to have to wait to get a replacement he uses our wifi at home or school to get online really the bottom line is i should not have to send something back for being outdated that i just bought as new who wants to mess around with all that hassle had i known ahead of time i would not have gotten this phone but i my son will live with it for nowso i can only give this  stars for them selling a phone that is outdated i took it to the att store within  weeks of my purchase date since it was wrapped under the tree then he used it before i activated the phone and it should not have had outdated firmware is anyone aware of how to get the firmware on line i would have no problem updating it myself since i have done so on other nonphone devices but i see no way to do that from the blu website,neutral

great product but the supplier needs to work on delivery and packaging when the parcel arrived is was almost completely open on one end the phone box could have easily slipped out of the box at any time during transit but fortunately for me this was not the case also the charging adapter given with the product was not compatible with the phone it refused to charge i had to use a different walltousb charger,neutral
ok the good  it has  it is compact and i love slider phones that cover up the keyboardand the bad  it was a pain in the butt to figure out the configurations to get the mms to work but that has  that is part of getting an unlocked phone every time i use the text to send to an email the phone turns off and restarts the keyboard buttons are pretty flat  are close together so it has  it is easy to hit the wrong button the camera quality is crap but you cannot really expect much from a phone like this the alarm feature worked like once it has not gone off at the time i programmed ever since,neutral

bought this for my wife to replace her z because she wanted a slider and needed a few apps that we could not quite get to work on bb well first off let me say that the bundled blackberry hub is broken and even after several updates still has problems notifications will just stop working for no apparent reason after some fiddling removing and re adding accounts it will work again for a random period of time txt messages will sometimes not even show up in the hub and even when they do you have to compose and reply to txt messages using the android messaging appshe is constantly missing notifications calls txts and bbm messages on this device because the vibrator on the phone is horrible i bought her a ditto to pair with the priv so that i could get a hold of her and even it only works with txt and phone calls just like every anrdoid device i have ever used it requires frequent reboots and has issues with app crashes it is pretty funny that there are android apps that crash on the priv continually and that same app will run on the z with no issuesbottom line is for  you expect the device to work out of the box and that just is not the case with the priv if you are an android user and want a slider you would probably be more than happy with the priv but if you are a blackberry user and expect it to be as reliable as a blackberry you will probably be dissappointed with the privby the time the wife was ready to throw in the towel on the priv it was too late to return it so now its hers for better or worse hopefully bb will fix the software issues with it at some point in time and it will be more usableother than the slider form factor and not having to side load or jump through hoops to get android apps running there is absolutely nothing about the priv that is superior to a standard blackberry devicewe are long term blackberry users and i have done my best through the years to support blackberry and to try to show people the benefits of blackberry vs other phones but i call it like it is and there is not enough blackberry in the priv currently the priv is a blackberry in name only hopefully blackberry will be able to make it more blackberry if that makes any sense i think bb users such as ourselves were expecting the priv user experience to be more blackberry than android and that has  that is just not the case,neutral
its a good phone has to problem you cannot change the battery closed and cannot input an sd cardi bought  of them and one has an error when its update de os is reparing it now because the rom fail i dont know if it has solution,neutral
i returned it it has some strange differences from the gt i did not anticipate h instead of lte connectivity no mic key on keyboard for voice input text messages searches email etc no swype or samsung type continuous input for the keyboard  i use it a great deal and find it very fast and efficient by the time i made that third realization i resolved to return it,neutral
not so fast as iphone ios  my last phone and the ics  sometimes stops and comes backthe overall performance is fine but the battery time is very short i charge every night and remove the power outlet at am at pm my battery is  i do not use it so much one or two short calls the entire daythe screen quality is awesome sound of phone calls are great too wi fi is perfect apps runs very good too the google store is better every day with great apps and games,neutral
i do not text much and my phone usage is simply standard call features that most voice only users needthe biggest reason for me to purchase this phone was to be able to use the touch screen feature instead of qwerty keyboard even after callibrating several times scrolling thru my contact list is not as easy as it is on an iphone or ipod touch screen i have one and it works flawlesslybut when scrolling thru my contact list the touch screen would be hyper sensitive and select contacts that just happened to be under the thumb while pushing the list to scroll upthis makes searching for contacts very annoying and is not helpful at all when looking for a number in a hurry and dialing italso the widgets for speed dial sometimes do not work and are not responsive not sure whythe other drawback for me is that after listening to a voice mail there is no number pad available to save or delete it may be there is a workaround out there that i am unaware ofother than that the screen size and ringtones are quite goodall in all if i had known of the above limitations i probably would not have purchased this phone,neutral
it is having trouble charging,neutral
this is a great phone for someone who does not use the internet as much as they use applications it also has older software so you cannot download newer apps that is really my only complaint but the phone in general in it has  it is time was a great phone,neutral
the watch is ok basic no frills you are getting what you pay for,neutral
it be freezing and the aps be closing on me and it has a mind of its own,neutral
is a good phons but battery life is awful,neutral
this was supposed to be a new phone there was something wrong with the charging cable as the phone did not recognize it as an apple product the contacts looked dirty and half the time it would not charge at all the phone also drops the wifi connection frequently im not all that happy with it but to be fair im still getting to know it expected better,neutral
it has  it is crazy strong take that military grade phones,neutral
i really wanted to like this phone more the price is right its unlocked has a nice big screen and has  sim slots after a week or so of use it felt as if the screen was slightly loose from the case when i would tap on the screen the screen made a physical clicking sound sent it back once i could feel the movement as well as the sound,neutral
not enough internal memory to be able to install multiple apps,neutral
my only problem is that the battery drains easilyseparate from that it is pretty much a good phone,neutral
it had a couple of buttons that were slow to work but for the most part it works fine thanks,neutral
the s active is a good phone i really liked all the features except that you could not change the home active screen for the appsbarometer compass etc i would have liked to be able to add or delete items to that screen on that notethe do not believe samsung when they say the s active is water  resistant it is not according to their own ip rating performance standards i am very thorough about my gear and made sure the battery case and the charger flip were properly stowed and inserted after a quick less than  minute dip in a river less than a foot deep it flooded samsung will not honor the warranty for liquid damage well if the phone had performed as advertised there would have been no damage to the phone this phone is rain sweat resistant only do not depend on it for anything else samsung has a tedious warranty process as well i was very unhappy with their customer service and im normally a very happy person buyer beware of samsungs false advertising,neutral
the product is ok and it works with a sim card from another country argentina till now at leastthe box look kinda open but i think its because they opened it to unlock itthe only important item missing in the box is the earphones that i think they took it to sell it or smtg besides that the phone looks like new and it is the galaxy  skyrocket,neutral
works as designed i have had no problems with the watch or phone to this point,neutral
i just gave it like a gift to someone who ask for it but i am understand that person is satisfied,neutral
use it for a while now so far so good only one major problem is can not use for hot spot because the staff who work at tmobile said it has  it is a att phone be careful with that,neutral
it was a good product for fair price i just did not like the display even though the resolution numbers are high somehow the display was not thrilling still a good product other than display quality all the features were working fine,neutral
resets every time to plug in err,neutral
you are suppose to scan the qr code to your phone so you can do more with your watch i have scanned it numerous times and all i get is a blank page also there is no way to adjust the volume on the watch,neutral
the phone was fine but since the description stated verizon ready i expected it to include the sim card so it could be activated right away it did not include a sim card and we found out that the local verizon store did not sell them so we had to place a separate order online and then wait for it to arrive before we could activate the phone,neutral
the photo does not work well the have to review the system it is necessary to make a manual that help the manual the send does not explain anything does not solve any problem,neutral
the phone is great but i got a broken camera and the horrible think is that it has the samsung international warranty unlocked phone that does not work at all i contacted to a service center in usa and was sent to service center in uk and then to australians one and then to usa center back so they sent me back and forth with no help at all  they have the worst support center ever they do not know enough information and do not want to help,neutral
when i received the phone the settings is in chinese characters and i have to search to my other phone in hiw tochange the language settings of it i did not expect that it would turn out like that i was confused if it has  it is made on china or what but it has  it is alright i have changed it anyways the phone arrived at good condition the earphones is not really good somewhat cheaper if i we are you buy an earphones,neutral
item was opened and box was dirty,neutral
ill start with the problems that the user has encountered so far we encountered a problem with connecting to our carriers internet i suspect that it has to do with how the phone tries to conserve energy because after awhile i was able to connect even though we have not moved from our location the biggest problem we have encountered was the phones inability to transfer app data from the phones internal storage to a sd card this will prove a limiting factor despite purchasing additional storage the internal storage is very limited in storage space the case is soft relatively and easily damagedit does have all the functions smart phone has that i have seen except for the app to sd card it has  it is a budget phone if you are heavy user of apps i would highly discourage you from it otherwise it has  it is an okay buy,neutral
good phone works with tmobile but only gets g apparently it does receive g but only with verizon i felt a little cheated on since i thought i would be able to get g with any carrier but my dad likes the phone,neutral
product is h but be aware that you need travel adapter the shipping was very slow which took about two weeks,neutral
finally everything was right,neutral
the phone is not really unlocked so i cannot use,neutral
did not meet its hype had to be reloaded and still has issue not pleased at all,neutral
it has  it is okay the battery life is about  hours,neutral
i really enjoyed this little dual sim phone the few days i had it but it would not install downloaded updates so had to go back im trying another one thru breed that has  that is refurbished so that should have fixed the flaw,neutral
battery life is too less this product is fine for use for not more than  months,neutral
was courteous with return and refund of phone had problems with actual device but was always wiling to help i would recommend to others,neutral
nice product but did not get my headphones,neutral
the phone is good it works with us based phone companies mine is tmobile and it works just fine with the tmobile sim it comes with eu charger and adapter for us wall plugs which i thought was interesting however my only disappointment would have to be is that it is slow and it lags horribly some apps take time to load up or some pages on the browser take a really long time to load it has  it is a little disappointing considering it is a samsung phone albeit lower end but still i have had phones that are cheaper in price and work better,neutral
this phone was purchase to go to jamaica to use with another network i must say that it works perfectit never give a problem all i have to do is put in your sim card and you are ready to go,neutral
so true phone was very inexpensive i only needed it to store phone numbers and a few speed dial numbers that has  that is it other than placing calls that has  that is what it does plenty of sounds so youre not stuck with something you absolutely hate the back falls off often and it takes a long time for the battery to charge if you need just barebonesbasic then this is it comes with two batteries,neutral
beware i like the phone it is beautiful but the fulfillment company new age products did not meet my expectations my wife ordered the same phone from them a couple of days before and it was just as described the phone was new sealed and unlocked but in my case it was locked to att after entering all my personal info i decided to check the imei and to my surprise i found out that the phone was locked  then i checked out the sim card slot and there was an att sim card i am having the phone unlocked and amazon is reimbursing me for the cost hopefully it will work thanks amazon,neutral
i have had my phone for at least a year and im very satisfied with my experience but the camera is not the best everything else is good but the music situation is very complicated because when im looking at the music app it does not seem to work the size is great it has  it is big but it still fits into my pocket but when i try to find accessories for the phone there are not many out there like when you lose your charger it is hard to find a new one online ive used my camera a lot but now i am not able to use my stickers and editing on the photos,neutral
got this phone for my son and he really likes it but was in his pocket and he tripped and fell and guess landed on the side the phone was on and it moved the screen monitor so there was no picture anymore did notify seller and they are replacing it as no cracks or any other physical damage seems very sensitive though if that has  that is what happens when it has  it is dropped hopefully just a freak deal,neutral
screen resolution really substandard sound pretty low in some cases bearly audible on max setting the bumper adds a great deal of safety while children are handling,neutral
this is a good product considering its cost not to be used as a full smart phone due to its limited camera definition and functions but a good temporary replacement or to be used by someone not looking for a highly technified or sophisticated device,neutral
have two of these phones for a couple of weeks one phone works perfectly no issue whatsoever the other one has the sod  sleep of death issue multiple times sod  phone shuts itself off google solutions and tried them all but nothing works downloaded the lastest os  gingerbread  thru samsung kies but issue remains this one is going back for an exchange neither of the phone is rootedoverall i really like the phone value vs price and i think you are not going to get a better deal a good beginner android phone that is almost iphone likepros screen size  is perfect for me the overall phone size is not too big either plenty of free apps to download gingerbread improves the battery lifecons internal memory is small you will not be able to download a lot of apps and you cannot install the apps to the external sd card unless you root the phone become a superuser but that immediately voids the warranty i read somewhere that you can unroot the phone if needed last minor issue the touch screen is not as sensitive as i like it but this could be the problem with having a zagg shield onupdate  received the replacement but it is also going back to amazon this time i did not even power up the phone the problem is on the touchscreen there are  spots about the size of a dime that cannot be cleaned looks like it is actually on the other side of screen this is really getting old all i want is another phone withour issue and dealing with the exchange process is a nightmare at least exchanging wireless phone is totally different than exchaning anything else amazon sells stay tune,neutral
was unable to use it with sprint so returned it but looked in good condition,neutral

wouldnt buy again the speaker got bad with just one month buy another cell phone not this one,neutral
for the price great but has some minor issues and bugs but nothing major,neutral
my mobile phone was delivered before the expected date of delivery the product was delivered in good condition but the high shipping charges  high import duty in india made it a very costly affairs as compared to its price in india as far as the actual product was concerned it was good for the initial few days of its usage but within its first week of its operation it started developing some technical problems like  the sound volume was completely gone i had to format the whole set again to get it back low battery backup does not even last for one daytime frequent hangings needs to be restarted again  again low downloading  processing speeds i need some sort of readdressal on these above mentioned issues,neutral
phone was ok for calls but lacks on video like youtube it fails to track gps location with google map or any navigation apps phone was returned within one week,neutral

the phone was working good had some trouble with connecting to my home wifi it said it couldnt connect yet it was connected and working finevery odd after that it worked good until i checked my voice mail and made my first call the sound quality was horrible i believe i had a defective model because i know this could not be the quality of the phone it was garbled as if the speaker was damaged i just got it from amazon yesterday i am returning it today not sure if i will give oneplus another try i miss my nokia windows phone i switched to blu but the batter connector failed so i ordered the oneplus  and now there is something wrong with it for now i am going back to a flip phone never any issues there,neutral
i was looking for a replacement of my nexus  which had been stolen with no insurance policy while the phone looks good the graphics arent terrible it is a lot better than other cheap alternatives like alcatel it has  it is getting me through but dare i say there has  there is nothing quite like the nexus  but overall a good phone and serves its purpose in size and durability,neutral
phone was used for a few days not brand new as said in the ad listing but packing was good and was in box along with new charger and new ear phonesoverall happy with the service,neutral
i had a little more expectation it has  it is okay but the phone is good,neutral

okay the phone came exactly on the estimated day and i was so excited to get home and break it open at first glance i was very pleased the phone feels lovely and the screen looks great very clear and vibrant the camera is honestly only good when it has good lighting i can go a full day without charging the battery with regular usage everything ran smoothly and i was very happy with the money i spent until i received a calli answered the phone and heard nothing i hung up and called back and still heard nothing apparently the earpiece does not work i was only calls to talk when i put the phone on speaker after updating and restarting the phone twice the earpiece still did not work i was so disappointed because i everything else about the phone worked so perfectly and to my expectations and then i find that one of the most crucial features of the phone does not worki have not seen this problem with anybody else yet but this has been my experience since i received the phone two days ago,neutral

i purchased this phone months ago it works fine for most purposes although it took quite a while to get it set up for straighttalk service but with persistence i got it almost fully functional i gave it only  stars as it had several problems i had to clean out the microphones before i was able to use the speakerphone feature i would have expected a thorough cleaning before it was sold as refurbished also the front facing camera does not work it is blacked out on the bottom half and is not usable this should have been revealed before purchase,neutral
spend the extra money and buy a better phone this one constantly freezes up when you use the internet not a that great a phone as i was expecting it works well but could be a lot better im disappointed that samsung leads it has  it is name to such a shabby smartphone brand spend the extra money and buy a galaxy s s or s,neutral
i ordered this off amazon tax free with two day shipping arrived in a timely manner but just got to activate it this morning activation is very simple the kit includes a sim card which you just insert above and to the left of the battery in the back then you will want to go to tmobilecomactivation and follow the instructions it comes with a random  balance for emergency instant calling or something i suppose but following the activation it takes you to where you can pay for your service online you can also get those cards at the store but honestly it has  it is so easy just to pay online and then you are good to go i chose the  unlim textdata   min plan you do not need to go to walmart or tmobile to get this to my understanding it is only available for new activationsthe price and quality of the phone is all great one problem i have with it is that honestly im not really an android fan i did not think i would mind it at all but somehow it really annoys me how much bloatware it comes with sure there are ways to delete it but people on reviews made it sound x easier than what i had to do i do not really consider myself technologically challenged but it was hard to find all the steps to uninstall this crap i did not want you cannot just go to the applications menu and drag what you do not want to the trash why everything ive tried to delete just stays there when i go back to the menu what the hell is that function for then why can i not just delete the stuff i do not want and there are manyim new to android so rooting was a brand new concept for me i must have downloaded  different apps off the android market to no avail i did not understand why the hell something called  uninstaller cannot uninstall apps after a bit of research and trying a bunch of different things i finally figured it outi figure id type it out in laymans terms for those who have trouble rooting turn on usb debugger settingsapplicationsdevelopmentusb debugging have the right usb drivers installed on your computer apparently these are difficult to find install the samsung galaxy x drivers from softpedia instead when i did this it told me it was not installed correctly but i could not find a fix so i just ignored it connect your phone to the computer via usb port then you can download superoneclick on your computer it is a computer application extract it is a zip file and run click on root top left big button it may take a couple minutes it should say root complete or whatever at the end and to confirm that it is indeed rooted you will see a superuser icon in the applications folder now you can begin the uninstallation but that is not all you have to download some more stuff to uninstall from the android market you can find some apps that will allow you to uninstall items android mate was too advanced for me you have to know exactly what files you are deleting which is a constant annoyance if you delete the wrong files then your phone might not work or it will brick kind of terrifying considering the price i paid i used titanium backup to uninstall items but you still run the risk of deleting things you need it is better to freeze the apps but that is a premium feature which you must pay for i also tried root uninstaller to no avail it did not show any apps besides market and itself for some reason im sure there has  there is something out there that might be better but so far my experience is that these apps are not that userfriendlyothers have claimed that the process above is easy but it was not for me apparently maybe some people know how to do this intuitively i do not know but think about it all i wanted to do was delete preinstalled junk like internet radios and more free apps apps but it took entirely way too long you can just press on any app in ios until it has  it is shaking and then press x to delete a couple seconds max i do not understand why it is so hard to delete things on the android not even including the risk of bricking your phone at every corneraside from my long rant in the end it is a good deal for a g smartphone and great rates on plans still im not too satisfied with android i feel like it has  it is one of those apple vs windows commercials comparing efficiency there has  there is a preinstalled antivirus free trial for  days then you have to pay really i never even thought that would be an issue with ios obviously these are my opinions and others will have no problems with the bloatware im a bit ocd and inefficiency is such an annoyance i just want my phone to run as efficiently and quickly as possible not having junk on it that tries to make me install more apps or pay for premium services yes the iphone costs way more but i would still rather have it than android that has  that is just me thougheditafter a few days of use im getting used to the android system more i do not mind it as much and hopefully it will hold up well it has  it is still a fantastic deal and with no contracts nonetheless in the end the savings are fantastic think about the activation fees and taxes and whatnot when you have to get a phone with a contract this phone is really a smart purchase,neutral
works nice all the buttons work good i love the side switch where i can just lock it and it turns the volume off instead of going into the settings and taking longer however it does shut off when there is still half battery life left and sometimes when i am in the middle of an appgame it shuts off as well but other then that its nice because its a working phone,neutral
it has  it is really expensive but bot very amazingthe finger touch does not work sometimes or many times so i have to cancel this function,neutral
i love this phone omg but it broke on the th day screen went out,neutral
broke in  months,neutral
phone works awesome but to bad ir does not have that much internal memory,neutral
in a world of smartphones if you want a basic function phone that has  that is just for calling andor texting this would appear to meet your needs i recently purchased one for my mother to use with a prepaid calling plan what was not clear when i bought this is that this phone only works with a g network and the carrier i obtained service from is shutting down its g network at the end of  if you need a gcompatible phone you shall  you will need something else from what ive read each major carrier is handling their g shutdown on a different timeframe so this may still work for you depending on your carrier,neutral
poor camera and is hot too due to the procesador so expensive,neutral
the phone arrived way before the eta it looks beautiful however the phone does not take a regular sim card only micro sim card i double checked with the manual that was provided and it said only micro sim card i just emailed the seller to see if they have any available for regular sim i purchased a international phone before a galaxy s mini and my sim card fit like a glove hopeful that the seller replies soon,neutral
hello i would give this phone a  star review everything works except for the ton of bloatware that was installed right out of the box antivirus software useless apps suspicious software and all the lg software as wellthis phone had so much trash that i only had  mb left in ram and i havent installed any of my apps i spent around  hours disabling and trying to uninstall all the bloatware i still have some lag while using the phone but after all the effort the phone works fine now,neutral
i bought this as a temporary replacement to my lumia  the screen had cracked from dropping on the pavementi notice the difference in performance between the two it has  it is like night and daythe win jr gets the job done but it has major performance issues that drive me crazycons the touch screen is not that sensitive and i have to mash icons over and over for it to respond sometimes there has  there is a ton of lag between switching between apps views pages etc and its not a smooth transition even after fixing the necessary setting it seems like the signal craps out when you are not actively using the device compared to the  screen is really lackluster and performs poorly in sunlight the camera quality on both ends is not good at all medium quality at best the charging port is at the top of the device which makes it awkward to use while charging minor nuance no dedicated camera buttonpros dual sim great price and fully unlocked decent speakers easy access battery back piece comes off fairly easily its a great looking phone good design comes with all types of accessories silicone case screen protectors charger headphonesall in all i guess you get what you pay for  is not bad for what it comes with especially if you use it as an interim devicemy advice is to get a higherend lumia if you can afford it ive had the  and the  and they are dream devices,neutral
love the iphone but the one i bought had visible signs of water damage in the inside i had to replace the battery did myself while i was doing that the screen cracked had to buy a new one on one of the metal covers there was rust and the charger that came w it literally stopped working  days after i got it i told seller they sent me  more both quit too but then again i bought my phone used,neutral
all i can say is i ordered the phone and it arrived on time i gave it to my yo daughter as a christmas gift as of right now it is working just fine i would recommend this to others,neutral

this phone is gionee elife e i think they renamed their product this phone is good but its hardware is outdate june the battery is very bad i cannot use it even in  day blu life pure xl is the better choice with more  bucks,neutral
almost after six months of use i can say it has  it is not for me the battery is shot and it laggs terribly this phone is more than enough for someone who has one page of apps and uses it for basic stuff do not try to multi task like i do with three pages of apps it will constantly over heat and turn off,neutral
touch respond issue,neutral
decent phone no problems but at that price a warranty would of gave it  stars,neutral

camera too slow cant access high resolution photosvideos unless you connect the phone to computer,neutral
i sadly had to return this one as the phone felt incredibly flimsy there was a bit of bloatware and overall the construction of the phone felt very chinamade and laggy shame because i did so much research on these blu phones and was looking forward to this higherend model but the reviews including professional ones just did not feel true to me if you want a sub phone stick to motorola moto g or something refurbishedi bought a refurbished google nexus   instead and it felt far more professionallymade and familiar,neutral
i received the phone a week ago and it shows that it is not the original lg g the display is pixelated the back scratches easily and the camera is terrible if you move it the slightest bit the phone supports hspa g on att but you have to set it up manually it is acceptable as a beginner phone but i am highly disappointed with the seller and their failure to clarify that this was not the lg flagship g i will not be returning the phone however because i do not want to pay return shipping i will be contacting the seller and amazon about this though,neutral
it is purpleblue color my yo has this and it works great she has dropped her phone many times and no phone breakageupdate after  months of using this case the rubber has started to peel i have very serious doubt that this is a real otterbox a real one would not start to peel buyer beware i will only order straight from otterbox now,neutral
it lags out and overheats a bit but its a decent phone if you are not a heavy user like me,neutral

minor very annoying glitch when texting not a like new purchase at all,neutral
the phone does not hold a charge very long,neutral
so the phone itself is good and the camera is excellent however some of the posts about carrier support can be misleading the support of tmobile is missing a couple of bands which leads to spotty coverage on edge and g coverage areas,neutral
the phone came dirty it works but is cleaning it off too much to ask,neutral
the phone is fine and does everything as expected the charger is not the original and it is really bad,neutral

cheap is ok is chine,neutral
overall i would give this phone  stars unfortunately it would turn off by itself constantly even when the battery was fully charged the only way that i could get it back on would be to remove and then reinsert the battery the touchscreen would freeze several times daily which also could only be resolved by removing and then reinserting the battery this phone has excellent features but crashes way too often and by that i mean daily if it were not for those issues i would have been very pleased with this phone overall most other functions worked well,neutral
very happy with the phone great buy,neutral
not terrible for  but can barely load one app and it stops sometimes average camera but really bad in low light conditions slow processor for browsing the internet decent telephone performance for voice calls lousy battery life and so far impossible to find a replacement battery three stars because it does work and we would have killed for this when i was a kid,neutral
the phone is very clean looking a bit hard to open but the buttons are very big it is very light weight the sound quality is good you get what you pay forupdate the call quality after a few days sucks even places with full bars people sound to loud or they are super quite cutting in and out further update will follow,neutral

the model shipped is actually an sl made for latin america aside from that the power adapter is the us standard english is available and the phone works fine on us networks but you will not find this phone on samsungs us web site so you cannot download the user manual which you shall  you will need because the tiny manual that comes with it does not cover much like sd cards finally samsung does not let you delete any of the apps bloatware they decided to include but that you do not want or need compounding the problem of the phones already limited memory,neutral

phone is okay at best physically the phone is nice and small and looks great but the functionality of the phone is poor options are very minimal it would be unfair to say phone absolutely sucks but considering price of phone cannot expect too much out of it i probably would never purchase another blu phone this model is fine but i have not had the greatest experience with other blu phones you truly get what you pay for,neutral

ive never purchased a grey market phone in my life so in all honesty i was not entirely certain what to expect well heres the deal i thought this phone was going to be everything and more than i expected and for the most part it is yes it works flawlessly on att just as long as you do not care about having a g lte experience at best you shall  you will get h speedson the upside not only is this a factory unlocked international version of the lumia  it comes without the crippling limitations found in the att variantspecifically this phone comes with  gb internal storage double the capacity found in att retail stores the phone also includes qi wireless charging which was notoriously removed by att from their version of the phone throw in a secure nanosim and high capacity microsd expansion and the phone has all the capabilities of even the most powerful smartphones on the market except for that pesky absence of g lte in the uson the downside did i mention this specific device does not include the lte bands used by us carriers that has  that is a deal breaker for me and so im returning the device the seller really should explain in plain text in the description that this is the international version and will not receive g lte data service for this reason i have knocked the item down to  stars otherwise it would have been  starsthe lumia  is a remarkable device yes it is large but remarkably light it does take some getting used to but once you have seen the stunning photos and incredibly smooth experience of windows phone  with the cyan firmware it more than makes up for any uncertainties i had about going with such a large phone that said if you are in the usa this is probably not the phone you want to purchase look for a lumia  model rm or rm instead,neutral

i would rate this device a  star but it does not come with a usb cable to connect to a pc maclg decided to put a usbc on both ends of the charge cable rather than a standard usba on the charge port side funny cause even apple still supports a usba on their cables while they charge  to require further adapters wherever they canthe devices has phenomenal hardware for the price but as a developer it has  it is a mute point if there is no way to connect the device to a pc maccables are cheap but this design choice should not have made it past product management looking at google and at the very least this should be explicitly noted in the product description on amazongreat phone long lasting battery light sturdy solid screen great calls get an adapter if you need to connect this to a dev environment,neutral

if you want protection  this is the case with the legendary otterbox stamp of approval this simply cannot be beat for the warm fuzzy feeling you get knowing if you dropped this bad boy you really should not worry too muchthat being said there are several reasons why i will not give this  stars it about doubles the weight of my tablet makes the tablet seem pretty hefty the coverstand think of the belt clip accessory that comes with a smartphone otterbox that has  that is this for a tablet it has  it is a completely separate piece does not do a good job as a stand even with it has  it is supposed  positions essentially it seems like and afterthought and im not sure why they could not integrate a stand into the case it has  it is not like they had to worry about weightsummary great case for protection i mean it has  it is an otterbox worth it if you do not mind significantly increasing the weight of your tablet and having to use a hunk of plastic the size of your tablet just to stand it up,neutral

for starters this thing does not run lte and barely runs g the feel of the phone is a little cheap its not very heavy and you can take the back cover off really easily the version of android is a little old but gets the job done on the plus side it does come with some average headphones an okay case and a screen protector the main camera is okay it does not handle movement very well the front facing camera is terrible and make sure that you get the  gb model because the operating system itself takes up like  gbs also make sure you get a sim card adapter for this phone because it only accepts full size sim cards not micro or nano cards there are lots of flaws on this thing heres another this phone can barely stay attached to wifi which means you constantly have to refresh the wifi in order to stay connected also the battery life is terrible and it can barely make it through the day all that being said it is only  and for  it is pretty good basically as soon as the motorola moto g nd gen lte comes out im ditching thing this because as a temporary phone its fine i could not imagine using it every day though,neutral

i really like this cellphone because it has no big cons first i start with the pros it has  it is really new quite stable build you probably can removereattach the backside for inserting a sim card which is important if you use as backup bright screen  good visibility even in sunlight very fast considering the ghz dualcore apart from gaming low power consumption and therefore battery life seems to be ok has most features of a modern cellphone frontrear cam flash gps hspa most of the other sensors as well dual sim sd card expansion have no app found which is not working properly so far except antutu noled app also working and not overheatingcons very slippery back and no covers available on amazon was not able to run antutu benchmark  app failed  maybe not enough memory only  gb space available  gb is used from system some bloatware preinstalled  most of them nonremovable camera  pictures quite dark blurry sometimes almost no color next to useless backside very hard to open very slowly charging still on android  and no update in sight i guess it will never come no front led for alerting after a few days i recognized that speakers are not very loud hence i missed  of the calls which is very bad  as well as it has  it is quite hard to understand the counterparty even my very cheap headset is much better im really close to give it backi bought it as a backup but not sure if i will keep,neutral
its ok it freezes quite a bit though but for the price cannot expect the greatest,neutral

i had to purchase a phone without a contract due to losing my samsung galazy iii to the bottom of a lake  i reseached the verizon phones my contract still had a year and a half and i was hesitant to purchase the verizon lg revolution but from the phones available it seemed to have the best reviews for a decent price the phone allows decent smart phone action and if i had not had the luxury of the galazy iii before this one i might think it has  it is a good smart phone it does not allow all the facebook capabilities that i was used to the camera is okaybut not nearly as clear my phone often gets locked up and takes a while to progress to the next or previous screen the keyboard which normally works from top to bottomor turned on its side often at least once a week gives me an error message and no longer works on its sidei have to do a hard shut down to get it back as other reviews have mentioned the battery life is not impressive if i do not use it very much through the day it will last until bedtime but if i textor especially if i make a phone call or two then it does not make it till the end of my workday pmoverall it has  it is fine i am not looking forward to another year and a half with it but it has  it is tolerable maybe better for a first smart phone for someoneso they do not know what they are missing,neutral
ive owned the moto x st gen  developers edition for a month it has been my sole phone and has had a lot of use the following is my review of the performance of the moto x over that periodthe goodthis phone is extremely snappy it moves from screen to screen and app to app very fast lag time is minimal while officially the moto x is a dual core phone it feels more like a quadcore this is due in part to motorola adding additional processors that focus on things like graphics and voice controls eight processors in total the additional processors only kick in when needed so battery life is maintained without compromising your experience the performance is also reasonably strong at multitasking with multiple apps running at once ive had netflix casting a show while playing temple run  at the same time no problem if you are concerned about the specs and it only having a dualcore processor do not be the design of the processors gives you all the performance you need at the tips of your fingersthe single greatest feature of this phone is the notification display the amoled screen allows the phone to only turn on the pixels it needs so instead of a little notification light the screen displays the time and an icon of the program sending you the notification email text facebook twitter cnn yahoo etc all of this is very customizable to the apps you prefer to receive notifications from in addition the phone will display the time and notification icon when you move so if you take the phone out of your pocket you immediately get a quick glimpse of what is going on when i first saw this feature i was not sure if i would use it that much now i think it has  it is a feature every phone should havemotorola and google have done a great job of integrating their products driving directions from google maps figures out where you work and live and has you morning commute ready to go when you get in the car the moto x knows when you are driving and automatically switches to hands free voice controls using google now and the moto x dedicated voice processor you can give commands to the phone without touching a single button expect to have lots of google apps cause they work so well with the moto xthe badthe camera is the one part of the phone that is lacking i heard this from reviews before i ever bought the phone and they were right the pictures appear grainy and seem to lack some bright colors the camera is passable for lite photo users but heavy users will need to look elsewhere buying a smart phone comes with tradeoffs and the moto x camera is the trade off herethe uglytwo weeks into owning the phone i began experiencing massive battery drain i googled the problem and there is a temporary fix that can be employed from the boot menu unfortunately the problem came back two weeks later i went to the motorola site to find an answer and they gave the same temporary patch i found on other sites a  phone with such a major flaw should have been fixed by the manufacturer by now the problem comes up in web searches a lot so i have to think this is happening to a number of moto x usersconclusioni would have a hard time recommending this phone to people knowing they could experience the same battery drain problem i have believe me i wish i could recommend it to friends who are looking for a powerful phone for less than  but until the battery drain is fixed i will not be able to spread the word about the moto x,neutral
i did a lot of research before i bought this phone i am with tmobile and did not have good reception with my old phone so i decided to get a new one i read good reviews about good signal with this phone it works ok signal is better than my old phone had but sometimes it is not too clear sound at another side when you talk be aware that this phone comes with charger only no accessories like usb cable manual or headset i downloaded dash manual from the internet and it says that a new phone comes with those  accessories so i called to amazon help and was told that i can return the item for a full refund battery is ok but phone needs to be charged daily even if wifi the internet off and you do not talk too much during a day,neutral
there are two scratches on the home button they are small but still you do not expect any imperfection on a  phoneotherwise the item is fine good performance and excellent camera,neutral
it came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but i expected it to be unlocked when i got it and tried to take it to a phone service company they said it was not unlocked soyeahgood overall though works great,neutral
good product but did not met my expectations complicated to change between languages and even worse to register a phone number the provided booklet does not provide enough instructions to achieve a proper use of the phone,neutral
the battery life after about  months got really bad when im playing games the phone gets really hotother than all of those fault its a really great phone great camera good speed and works great with everything else,neutral
worked for about a week and then the tower signal started fading and disconnecting completely g networks are supposed to become retired and its causing network problems i was never able to run data trough phone the positive is a trial on smart watch usage,neutral
it is a good phone however it cannot turn on automatically before alarm which means that you will have to leave the phone on overnight in order to get the alarm to work,neutral
the watch is decent but its still missing a lot i paired it with my iphone s and i liked that i was able to get notification alerts however the alerts pushed any notification that came through my phone and the maximum amount that it shows on the watch is  every time i got any sort of alert it would say i have  new messages even when i only had one new one and the rest were old you cannot reply back to anything and the ui is laggy the watch interfaces had a small selection and none of them were to my liking the phone option is probably the best working part about this and the option i would use the least you can actually call directly from the smartwatch there is a dial pad speaker and mic when using the siri option it works ok but it acts as if you are calling yourself overall it has  it is a nice smartwatch for the price but i would rather have more compatibility,neutral
worked for two months only tried to factory reset  bought replacement battery  nothing worked writing for manufacturers warranty this is a jokei finally had to box it up and send back to florida they did replace it with a new one but it took weeks if you can be without a phone for that long no worries followed all videos on youtube about hard reset fixes etc i am a relatively advanced user just sort of an unlock and could not get it fixed without sending back i will update when it kicks the bucket again,neutral
im still happy about my purchase but there are some things that i must warn people who are considering to buy it the overall quality is good enough to satisfy you but the os is just a disaster this is not like normal nokia we have known there so many lacking and missing functions and it is super sluggish when writing text buy it if you do not care about these but i still like this phone so far,neutral
the phone works great all around the only issue i have is the mini usb port on the two phones i purchsed are non functional after two months and the parts are almost impossible to find i am still searching for a repair shop to find them if k find one id gladly give it  stars finding a case has been a bit of an issue too,neutral

update below i did a lot of research on this phone ive heard many stories about the screen cracking and ive seen many reviews where the screen was torture tested and held up fine my conclusion is that there are many fakes out there that are essentially exactly the same but with lower quality screens that shatter when dropped from above about  feet those are the ones sold by the other company somethingsky or whatever it has  it is called im almost certain these are the real ones i waited a week and a half to write this review for that reason im very tough on phones ive already had this thing underwater dropped it hard multiple times from roughly  ft on hard surfaces and there is not a scratch on it i customize my phones to no end but the version of android that came on this was the coolest stock phone setup ive seen yet my last phone was an umi emax and even if this was not a rugged phone i would take the performance of this over the blu it has  it is a  ghz processor but man does it make use of it the battery life is phenomenal and this is already by far my favorite phone that ive bought if you need a weatherproof phone that has  that is fast and has the craziest battery life you have seen buy this also it shipped from china in  days i was shockedupdateso the screen broke it took a really hard fall on the edge and shattered badly they are making replacement lcds now which are actually pretty cheap at  if the screens on the replacements are a little better ill be satisfied with my purchase,neutral
at first i was very happy with this phone now not as much i find that it will periodically lose the signal and i will have to remove the battery to reboot the system this is really annoying when it happens in the middle of a call i do believe that i will be replacing it soon and not with another hp product,neutral
very nice phone very long battery life the only complaint is that i wish all apps would be available for this phone and that the screen sensitivity would be better for some games that require multiple finger action,neutral
bought two one works fine but other fails to find network properly,neutral
nice phone works as it is supposed to except for wifi calling after purchasing the phone i discovered that even though att and tmobile phones will work on each others networks att did not and still does not support wifi calling for android phones if this is a feature you want on a tmobile network look elsewhere as the phone cannot be easily updated,neutral
nice phone initially but it makes a clicking sound when an app like whatsapp receives a message and it gets hot when apps are running so much so that it shuts down after about  minutes when using waze due to overheating battery life is short less than half day from just using waze a bit and whatsapp for some reason contacts are showing up repeated when i search as much as  times the same contact shows up,neutral
pretty good but the operating instructions are weak,neutral
it has  it is not as responsive or quick as it should be but it will do in a pinch,neutral
love the phone first off go to settings then about device and then android version  and click it over and over till it shows shapes on your screen tap thatand enjoy a very hard popular game from couple years agoclear screen and camera is great and i owned a honer x the unlock comes naturally to me and it will work  device feels solidusing alot of apps will sure come in handy it has  it is gb ram which comes to gb normally people on network or facebook etc  days use u notice it uses about  of memory leaving u with about a gig and it has  it is smoothi like this launcher others probably do not but it has  it is tons of apps one more thing before i hit end take advantage of the amazon app and apps and games you have access to underground games and apps  free if u have prime and i love that overall an a plusupdate flaws in buttons on very bottomone the do not light up so u cannot see them and mine would stick and phone freeze i still like the idea phone needs tweaks and speakers in the back was not compatible in for my sound stayed blocked in my handso  stars instead of  after a week phone is not for me,neutral

i got this phone for my year abroad in spain im about  weeks in and the phones battery life is probably the main problem ill leave with it fully charged and within a half hour of being out it shall  it will drop to about   even if im not using the phone it almost seems like it drops on an exponential curve and not the favorable kind for battery life getting it to charge is another frustration in and of itself sometimes the cord works sometimes it does not it has  it is not a normal microusb cord so i cannot even use a cheap replacement to test it out sometimes the phone will only charge if i have it sitting juuuuuussssstttt right or if im physically suspending the cord in a position that somehow speaks to the phone like i said frustratingaside from battery life the phone lags a lot it seems like i cannot really have more than one app open at a time if i want anything to work properly i guess the s has a slightly older computer because i never had these problems when i used an s anyway the lag is particularly frustrating when im trying to figure out directions in a foreign country so the phone really is not doing a great job for the one reason i purchased itthe camera lags a lot as well sometimes the lag ruins the photo if i move the phone even  second after ive pressed the capture button but i got a dslr for taking photos so im not too bummed about thishowever it worked with the sim card with no issues whatsoever when i have one application open am near a charger and outlet and have time on my hands the phone works great otherwise it has  it is purely ok this is not the phone for someone who wants instant gratification this is the phone for a patient person who probably did not mind dialup internet too much,neutral
add more description to the phone because when i had received mine the home button had some problems and did not want to work sometimes also with the phone speakers i am a person of music i like to always listen to music but when the speakers do not work fully it disappointed me overall the phone was a great buy and i really enjoy it,neutral

good phone for the basics i am a high volume texter  the long battery life is good for that the major downside to this phone is the microphone and the speaker phone are one in the same volume if you are okay with holding this to your head all the time then do not worry about that aspect but the screen can and will freak out with the tiniest bit of liquid sweat on it you get what you pay for with this  phone works as a phone cannot handle many apps at once duh  low ram and slower processor battery lasts a heck of a long time and great for your basic calling and texting  great phone to have in a drawer as a spare for when you break your better phone and await a warranty,neutral
the phone had a little scratch on the back and the box looked like someone already had opened it however the phone is working fine and we really like it takes good pictures and the screen is crisp and clear,neutral

i do not love this phone for a couple of reasons which may not matter to others  there is no user manual available  none came with it none is available online so while i am able to use it i have no easy source to figure out a number of issues  there is a known problem with the camera orientation which is that some thirdparty apps like my banks mobile app are not compatible with the orientation of the camera this is a pita when trying to take pictures of checks for deposit the solution suggested on number forums is for us  the users  to contact the developers of the third party apps and scold them for not updating the apps to keep up with this and perhaps other phone cameras not something im going to be doing so despite having bought a case a screen cover and the adapters necessary to use all my chargers with this usbc phone im seriously thinking of returning it while i still can,neutral

the phone which they claimed to be brand new turned out to be refurbished using nongenuine parts however these guys at zbfatima did an impressive job making it look and feel legit so i bumped my rating up to  stars in appreciation of their effort next time please try to get the name right its z compact not z mini and correct the misspellings on the packaging thank youp the back panel of the unit notice how the logo on the fake oneupper left is noticeably darker and thicker than the originalp the manual that comes with the unit appears to be made for another phone from the sonyericsson era as it features screenshots from the old android  and referred google play as android market it also mentioned about some features that are nonexistent on this model such as physical menu buttons and hdmi portp theyve even gone to the trouble of making a printed screen protector for added authenticity unfortunately they just couldnt be bothered to get the name right it says xperia z mini instead of xperia z compact and its actually xperia z thats featured on the illustrationp as with other refurbished phones ive previously experienced with the identification tag which is a plastic slip you can pull out underneath the bottom flap is missingp for added hilarity the digital is misspelled as digitrl,neutral
i cannot fairly review as it only worked for me about  days no sooner than i got halfway used to using it i rolled over on it with a socket in my pocket broke the screen and now it only shows a bunch of lines cannot say anything bad since that was my fault however i have done lots of stuff without breaking the old phone i kept in the same pocket but it had a smaller screen i got used to doing without some of the features of my old phone but loved the camera which took great pictures,neutral

one of two amazon warehouse deals gone bad this one has short battery life issues and some serious cleanliness issues tooamazon warehouse deals ratings of the products are inaccurate i covered it in my sellers reviewcamera kicks massive butt here the sony sensor makes a world of difference and really takes the best cell phone picture including the slave owners over at apple whose human rights abuses and cooperation in spying on dissidents in china and other humanrights repressed countries while refusing to help break into a dead terrorists iphone is appalling it has  it is not the number of pixels it is how they are handled,neutral
when i first unpackaged this i tried many features and i loved it but then the problem i have owned cell phones for well over  years going back to the basic nokia and i have owned many cell phones i love a challenge and something different so i was perplexed that my sim card would not go into the phone it just did not fit i tried two different adapters the sim card fit the adapter but the adapter would not go into the cell it seemed just slightly too big it has  it is a nice phone with great features that seem to all work but if i cannot call and text i cannot use it i am returning the phone,neutral
i waited until this phone was offered by amazon directly because a year ago i purchased a bb pearl from another vendor through amazon and it did not last a year failing from day one this time i thought amazon would be a more trustworthy source it was quite disappointing i got a phone in it has  it is own box but firs thing that stroke me a  year warranty card from consumer certified repairs this phone is supposed to be new i got a refurbished phone next disappointment a cheap battery not the original blackberry battery it holds a charge for about  hours i had to but another one which was another nightmare because amazon sells many as the same that comes with blackberry phones and the picture is of an original battery at  now i do not trust amazon so i did not purchase any of these but had to shell out another  for a seidio another thing i believe this phone should have included a protective leather case which comes with every bb and i did not get it now my last and greatest grievance and it goes in another paragraphi was not able to get this phone on a blackberry plan at the phone company they told me that the series this phone belongs to is not in the blackberry database so it cannot be set up in the bb plan i did not get any specifics not sure what that means and not even sure if it is banned for any reason or what anyways this is the last time i buy a cell phone from amazon the phone works very well so my review is not a total sucks but it reflects my dissatisfaction with amazon,neutral
my wife using it for  months now time for a reviewoverall not a bad phone but not without problems do not want to repeat after other reviewers just to sum it upbiggest pro by far  battery lasts forever  days easily between the changes way above anything else i saw in smartphone worldbiggest cons  very quiet ring we did everything we could my wife does not hear the phone ringing too often actually a deal breaker for us looking for another phone,neutral

the buttons are so small on this phone it has  it is no joke it has  it is a lot smaller than the picture shows im buying the phone for a family member so have not used it to review the working,neutral
usability wise it has  it is okay but not great the phone could make contacts more accessible since it has  it is a primary function of calling messaging and emailing but outside of google contact information the phone does not make this feature as readily accessible as samsung or apple platforms it also uses unique icons for common systems like settings which makes it difficult to navigate at first the use of stacked windows and layers also make some other commonly used features less accessible the sound is great the camera is satisfactory compared to a dsl for a phone is fine the screen resolution is fine and the battery life is fine everything is fine with this phone but nothing really stands out this is my first htc phone and the initial opinion was meh enough where i got my samsung s repaired rather than throw it out,neutral
has to be rebooted to play pandora or to go into your gallery i understand that its light on ram so if you want to use those apps go with an upgraded model it does not have the sensor to turn the screen off while it pressed up against your face so you can and will hang up while talking other then that it has been a great priced decent phone,neutral

i decided to purchase the lg nexus x after my oneplus one was stolen the new lg nexus x phone arrived quickly thanks amazon and after the two hour setup and updating process i was generally impressed with it however after around hour  the phone began to constantly emit a staticrattling sound from one of the speakers after several restarts which resulted in the sound getting louder and longer between breaks i contacted lg support to have the unit replaced after all its under the initial  year warranty lg claims that since i purchased the phone from amazon and not through google or lg they could only repair the phone no advance replacement would be shipped to me and the turn around would be around  weeks because lg could not be sure that the phone was a refurb or a counterfeit the employee asked for the imei number to even go so far as to verify that it was a new noncounterfeit phone i hung up in frustration and contacted amazon they sent a replacement overnight thanks amazon im leaving a star review because  this seems to be a common problem with the phone lg  do right by your customers and resolve this manufacturing issue  lg customer support is horrible,neutral

decent phone shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended it was while i was playing kingdom hearts unchained x symptoms were phone got hot touch screen became unresponsive on and off the next day blue screen rebooted another blue screen then phone completely dieddual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that has  that is a huge plus mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones do not even include them anymore but the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom if you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car things will get messy as there has  there is no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging however the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside downcoming from a samsung galaxy s the idol s screen is much more vibrant also the phone is about mm thin which is just mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there also you should plan on getting a case for the phone the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone so if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone the chance of it falling is quite high another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to android marshmallow which no one thought they would do considering the idol  was coming out the idol  was made by a chinese company which do not really provide software support and that the idol  was a budget phone the stock os does not really come with a lot of bloat although surprisingly the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg the same guys that make the antivirus which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app the updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the googles material design to some awkward interface the average rating was around  stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app the biggest con i would have to mention is the very slow flash storage this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play storeoh well time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover i set the expected usage to a year anyways when i bought the phone considering it was only  when i bought it the phone did get cheaper but that has  that is to be expected as time goes onupdate wow so they still honored the warranty when my phone died fantastic service they went above and beyond they shipped the phone back with  day ups air too,neutral

i liked this phone until last week when a dead zone appeared at the top of the screen about  inch going straight across the screen i went online and saw that this is a fault with this particular phone and many many people are complaining about this problem why is lg selling a faulty phone and is not amazon aware of this i live in the caribbean and it is not easy to return the phone as it is under  months old i honestly thought lg made quality phones i have taken good care of my phone and was shocked to find that it does have a fault would not recommend this phone at all on you tube there are many inquires as to how to fix this particular problem so the company has to be aware of it and it should be recalledwould never buy anything lg again also surprised that amazon even sells it,neutral

my practically yearold daughter chose to get this phone with some early birthday money now we do not live out in the sticks but we are not in a major metropolitan area either so for us verizon is really the only carrier that works i had given my yearold daughter my old samsung s that had been active on verizon i set both girls up via tracfone so they do have phone numbers but their devices are mostly mp players for them heres the thing the first tracfone set up on my old verizon device works great everywhere now this blu phone took a little more time to set up from scratch as the phone is brand new i noticed that in and among all the information i was entering that it clearly used atts towerswhich means it does not get much in the way of a signal and cannot be successfully and consistently used as a phone that makes calls for responsiveness screen looksit has  it is a great little phone it has  it is the right size for what she wants to use it for and it has  it is not sluggish i added some memory to it and it has  it is got all the games and music that she wants to have with her there are however two downsides one involves the case it does come with a very thin clear gel case it has  it is not shock proof but i suppose it has  it is better than nothing i got a shield for the screen separately so if you are getting this for a young girl who wants a fun phone caseit has  it is not gonna happen downside twoit stopped working it will not charge it just ceased to be there has been no water damage it has  it is not cracked it does not appear to be damaged and yet it does not work maybe this particular one is a lemon i suspect most of these phones work for more than two weeks i guess ill soon find out how good their customer service is,neutral

this is the nd asus zenfone  that i have owned rip the firstthe phone can handle most games thrown at it but the back does get a little warm with the more intensive titles the beefy ram and memory capacity with expandability really sell the phone for me with other phones there will be a point where you will have to decide what you want to keep and what you can uninstall  delete i am not always in areas that have great data signals or near wifi so i cannot really rely on the cloud so it is really nice knowing that i can just store what i need on my deviceas others have said asus has a problem with preinstalled apps i think there are like  but they are all very tiny and honestly do not take up that much space so i just hide and forget though that does not excuse it also asus will update their apps and their launcher but i am still using lollipop we were supposed to get marshmallow sometime within the second quarter of this year still waiting for that,neutral

i really liked the phone but the speakers were horrible horrible horrible even when i plugged up the phone to my big speaker in my room for surround sound there was no bass all treble volume was completely limited when i used the headphones that came in the box and the ones i had bought from a local discount store i could still hear outside noise just could not get a good sound like usual i like blu phones i have been buying them for my  teenage boys the last couple of years this is the first one i have received where the speaker quality was not good the camera was ok pics not clear unless you are very still and when you are still the pic looks a lil cloudy front and back cam i am replacing my sam  so the cam quality has to be better than what i have and it was not i was going to make due with it if the speakers would have been better the size and picture quality was nice had a lil weight to the phone  but i could not find my mobile hotspot i was a lil disappointed in this phone blu your company should definitely consider revising the attributes of this phone,neutral

seems like a nice device but the sound quality is bad worse than the  year old phone i replaced unless i talk at the tiny mic opening at the bottom of the phone the people at the other end of the call cannot understand what i am saying the clear case may partly cause this problem  or not i put a tracfone gsm sim card in  that was a mess but eventually got straightened out  i hope do not know if i will be able to access the web via att  so far i have only used my wifi which works perfectly im obviously not a techie so using this unlocked phone was a challenge i hope i can figure out the sound quality issue  since i bought it to use it primarily as a phone,neutral
this phone has great software and features but its build quality is poor in comparison to its predecessor the e loud speaker is not particularly good the dpad is terrible and the dpad button due to the optical navi feature is always loose the phone feels very cheap in the hand and battery door is poorly designed to where the latch is easily tripped and the cover occasional comes offi would not recommend this phone get an e and you will get the a nokia handset with superb build quality and software that is pretty much the same as e with mostly no insignificant differences that most users including my self do not miss,neutral

i bought this case to use for my trip to the dominican republic since i have the tendency to always have my phone in my hand and it tends to end up in puddles or on concrete etc long story short the phone was great as far as protection goes  which is exactly what i was looking for in a case while i was on vacation however this is not practical as an every day casefor this case to be waterproof there is a hard plastic covering over the microphone on the bottom of the phone to protect the phone from any possible water damage because of this feature even when the flap is open it sounds like you are in a tunnel to the person who is on the other end of the phone during a phone call i found myself not being able to use it to make phone calls with the case on but i was on vacation and it was not necessary anyway i currently have the otterbox commuter series case on my phone for every day use and if i happen to be near a body of water for example on a boat or at the beach i switch over to this case for the day for the waterproof feature,neutral

when i bought this phone i was under the impression that the entire unit was refurbished but the cosmetic appearence was not great there were scatches on the face plate and every corner was dented or damaged the phones back cover wouldnt stay on in one corner because of the damage after some slight adjustment to the plastic i managed to get it to fit and stay on the phone itself is great no electronic issues at all and ive been using it for a while now happy with its preformance just not its cosmetic apperance,neutral

not a bad phone speaker phone is useless it is so quiet you cannot even hear it even when it has  it is right up to your head the regular phone volume is not much better good luck hearing it in a crowded room the speaker phone does not work with headphones so you can plug it into your car and talk and listen at the same timethe camera is ok not much for options overalls speed ok if you want a huge phone this one works but you need two hands to operate it none of the cases work for this phone power button and volume buttons are the same side which makes it difficult to distinguish quickly do you want a cheap phone that has  that is okay then this is your phone,neutral
extremely big phone i use it as a tablet,neutral
i give it  stars because there has  there is a off on the screen i do not what it is for,neutral
phone was not in working condition version was unable to activate the phone under my number because it was still active under another account the company said they could not fix the problem because they did not have the information of the previous owner they should have thought that through before they sold the phone,neutral

as someone who just wants a good small phone for making phone calls i found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone i could find the phone i replaced was a bar phone the size of a chicklets box every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flipphone garbageso i chose this phone entirely for its size not because it has  it is a smart phone keyboard way too small to type on and i was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth i do recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls but do not get your hopes uphaving said that you get what you pay for the pictures provided by the manufacturer are very misleading showing a standard android launcher screen when in fact this phone has a cheap custom ux that tries and fails to look like ios for no discernible reason this custom ui does not use android standards  for example  there is no apps tray and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not  it has a recent apps button but it has  it is inexplicably used for settings instead  recent apps is instead found only by holding down the home button the paltry user guide has no instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom ui so you are completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach recent apps so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens tap and hold on empty spot of launcher instead of using the perfectly fine android contacts app there has  there is a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired you cannot edit or delete contacts stored on your sim card but you can add new sim contacts  you shall  you will have to download sim contacts by penumbraapps from play store  the maximum volume on the handset is not loud enough the maximum volume on the speakerphone really really is not loud enough you cannot change lock screen background to pic  you are stuck with what they give you because of screen size keyboard is nearly impossible to type on  download touchpal which is a the best keyboard for android anyway b allows you to resize it i can type on this one status bar shows mobile  wifi signal strength but does not show bluetooth status again silly custom ui  however there is a power control widget you can put on the home screen for that the battery monitor is wildly inaccurate if you keep your phone numbers on your sim the direct dial widget thinks every phone number is a mobile phone and you cannot change it the accelerometer is sketchy  when pulling phone down from face during call screen comes on only about th of the time  worse power button does not start up the screen during calls about  of the time eitherif anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore i probably would not have even looked at this one but if you want a small phone with decent call quality you are pretty much stuck with this,neutral
it is working well it was a replacement for my blu vivo hd and is a real improvement with gb of ram instead of the gb that the vivo hashowever both phones share at least two design flaws imho the battery is nonremovable so you cannot have a charged spare when the other dies and also both phones have the loudspeakerbuzzer in the back near the bottom so if you place them over a lined table or other soft surface facing up you may not hear an alarm notification or callalso another annoyance that should have been documented but is not these phones do not have dualstandby that means that if you receive or make a call on one line the other one gets blocked both calls and data during the call i thought that being a newer model it would have such a feature as i said it is not documented anywhere,neutral
i did not get the color i wanted so i kinda feel cheated out of my money but still a good phone,neutral
pros  phone is huge which i love  its very lightweight  pretty thin  sounds decent  graphic quality too cons  for some reason this phone goes in  out of service  i have to restart it over  over  when i first got it almost a wk ago  my music wouldnt play  my pictures wouldnt open  i cant call out or receive any calls when the phone acts up  im very frustrated w it becuz i have important calls to take  it does not help when i miss them ,neutral

context i use my phone heavily for voice contacts email calendar web browsing navigation office documents and pdfs roughly in that order i do not use facebook twitter or generic text messaging my contacts and calendar come from outlook and it has  it is vital that all the detail kept by outlook for calendar and contacts items be shown on my phone i strongly want a physical keyboard but also like a big touch screen i travel a lot both nationally and internationally and am often in rural or other nonmajorcity areasgiven all that ive been a very happy user of an htc tilt  still avaialble used from amazon athtc tilt  touch pro unlocked smartphone with  mp camera g quadband gsmgrps wifi qwerty keyboard microsd slot operating on att wireless this operates on all the gsm and nearly all the g frequencies used around the world has a big sharp responsive touch screen which slide across and tilts up when i want to use the phones excellent keyboard it looks nice and has good battery life bluetooth and wifi work reliably and solidlythe operating system is my favorite of all ive tried the late and asyetunequaled windows mobile  this provides the bestyetseen compatibility for outlook and office along with compact efficient and in many cases nicely customizable uis for the apps good enough that i turned off the htc sense ui that came with the phone a decent range of commercially available thirdparty apps and a generally clean rational method of operation for those who do not need violent graphics and boredom relievers my one major customization was to install opera mini an excellent browser which wm was willing to recognize as my default browserunfortunately my tilt  has become a bit creaky occasionally dropping voice calls after a few minutes even when signal is good it is also not as plain old gorgeous or as slim as the nokia e which is what i decided to try after finding so few current phones with large slideout physical keyboards and no other businessoriented gsm phone with a tilting screendespite really wanting one in dark grey available in the rest of the world but not with a us warranty i bought a new silver e from amazon who delivered it promptly as always and proceeded to try it startup was easy i simply took the sim card out of the tilt  put it into the e and had connectivity as soon as the e started syncing contacts and calendar items from outlook was easy after trying both i found nokias pc suite much preferable for my needs i do not need the entertainthekids aspect of ovi suite and do not want my info stored on nokias server but i do need regular automatic sync when the phone is connected to my desktop via usb and quickly had all my many contacts and calendar items on the eexcept i did not quite to a degree that has become unacceptable the symbian contacts app does not recognize all and misinterprets some of the phone number fields of an outlook contact also if you use the extension field in an outlook contact symbian concatenates the extension onto the phone number resulting in something atts network cannot understand at all worse the symbian contacts app simply cannot cope with a long note in an outlook contact after losing much of some valuable long notes in some of my key outlook contact items and finding no way to scroll through a long note in a contact on the e i realized i just could not use the e as a mirror of my outlook info the symbian calendar app similarly does not properly or safely handle outlook calendar itemsthere are more disappointments ovi maps looks great on the phone works fairly well and is to be commended for storing the maps on the phone greatly reducing data consumption during a trip but keeps losing gps signal in places where the tilt  never had trouble and thus is very busy and noisy frequently recalculating the route quickoffice is ok but nowhere near as compatible with ms office as is the version thereof on wm  the e freezes every day or two often by showing a frozen and diagonally smeared version of the last screen that operated it also hangs up and becomes unresponsive to input for several seconds at a time now and then with few if any open appsit has  it is possible the new symbian anna release might address some of this but anna is not yet forthcoming in the usall this makes me sad indeed because ive gotten quite fond of the look and feel of the e hardware and of the moderately customizable home screens if i could work around the problems listed above id happily keep the phone even though the nokiams deal may very well supplant it by sometime next year however at least for me the e is at best a prototype with very rough software of a phone id like to own when they finish it,neutral

phone is okay at best physically the phone is nice and small and looks great but the functionality of the phone is poor options are very minimal it would be unfair to say phone absolutely sucks but considering price of phone cannot expect too much out of it i probably would never purchase another blu phone this model is fine but i have not had the greatest experience with other blu phones you truly get what you pay for,neutral

everything about this phone screems  phone it is missing nfc and a few other things like fingerprint scanners which arnt a huge deal especialy for the pricethe real big problem is the lack of certain bands that att use bands  and  without those your connection will not be as good or work at all in some areas where i live in south texas near corpus it was very hit or miss in some places it worked fine and in others not at allmy older samsung galaxy grand prime got signal everywhere and its because it has all the antennas for all the bands frequency ranges that att usethe mobile hotspot works good the screen looks amazing the speaker sounds pretty good and loud only a little tinny on some songs at max volumethe camera works great and the software is not as bad as some make it sound it actually has some cool features built into itbut i had to return this phone because i didnt get signal in places i should have i really wanted this phone to work if it wasnt for the missing bands this phone would by far be the best phone for the price,neutral

well as stated by others this is not a top tier phone it gets wonky when you have a lot of apps installed especially if the apps have notification features activating frequently it has  it is a starter phone and the pricing relfects it it has  it is a good phone for making and receiving phone calls texting not so much for interactive data services one thing i have found great about this phone is if you are interested in great quality music try downloading the poweramp application at your app store for a pittance it turns the ho hum audio into a high end audiophile machine i broke my old  month old exhibit from t mobile simply removed the sim card flash card and kablamo i was back in business now as to t mobile itself well it has  it is a starter network if you need business enterprise class callingdata service try another network this is a weekender product and package,neutral

this phone is a beast with its super octacore i absolutely loved this phone for the short time i got to play with it before it decided to take a dump on me and break my heart first off yes this phone is all that and a bag of chips sleek fast and did i mention a beast well right out of the box it had trouble with fluxuations and connecting to towers it would connect but it wouldnt connect strongly so i contacted my provider and hey set up a service order to check out and run diagnostics on my local towers to see if they were indeed compatible with this model and if it was then it would tell me that something in the phone was defective i plugged in it to let it charged while i watched some tv and when i came back the screen had went screwy even after removing battery and doing a master factory reset the problem persisted the problem being that there were hundreds of faint lines running across the screen and a large black mass in the bottom left corner that would grow and dissipate when the screen was rotated everything would swirl and stay swirled even the colors were off no the phone was not dropped and yes it had been working fine except for the signal thing before charging i decided to call samsung to see if the phone was worth saving but was informed that as it is an international phone it is unable to be worked on unless i lived in europe as the usa does not work on international phonesso instead of reordering and praying that it will work i am just returning this phone and sucking up loosing the extra fast processor and ordering the slower us model from my carrier i am doing this solely due to if it breaks in a few months i can get it fixed for free with my warranty where if i bought another international version and it broke i would have to come up with  to replace it as it cant be fixed inside the us,neutral

first of all for the price it cannot be beat the features and apps are not  am not quite as refined as the samsung phones but overall it works quite well it seems to work well with my tmobile account and shows lte most of the time here in the north metro atlanta area this is actually my second one the first lasted about  hours and just quit flat the first time i warmed it up by turning on the gps amazon took amazing care of the problem and i had a replacement within two days even though i called them on a weekendthe limited color choices are annoying come on im a business guy give me a black phone the least goofy color available was white with a clear silicone protective case and after two weeks it has  it is starting to show especially stuff getting in between the case and the phone clear case  white phone everything showsnone of the makers of accessories seem to know about blu and good luck finding cases and holsters it has  it is the same size as the galaxy note  so things that fit the gn should fit the blu since spare batteries are also hard impossible to find plan on keeping it plugged in just in case whenever you can battery life is not bad but it will not last a full  hour day of use like my old blackberry didmy only serious beef is that the gps is pitifully weak laying on the dash of my car it only occasionally locks on and the rest of the time is searching for satellites ive noticed that the bluetooth connection is also significantly weaker than my previous phones and those of others in my family since i intended to use it in the cockpit as a backup moving map the gps thing is a serious drawback for me but ive decided that ill keep it as just a phone,neutral
no app menu everything sits on the home screen unless you make a folder for it still a decent phone for the price you pay though,neutral
found that on advanced settings for the screen timeout you lose total control of the phone and cannot do anything cause it just goes black the best thing to do is adjust that and just keep the basic functions after all this was corrected i found the phone to be very operational to its fullest after correcting these little things the phone has been very good for the price,neutral
received the phone with what looks like its original bb packaging i was able to setup and configure right away with now problem until i started making calls from my phone book it adds a  prefix on the telephone number which makes it an international call to somewhere in asia had to call tmobile for support and had me update the firmware which did not work still anyway to make the story short i just had to take out the number infront of the telephone number registered on the phone book and everything worked,neutral

this phone was purchased for a trip to europe because we needed a data capable phone it was marketed as a global phone tried it in the us worked perfectly with a att sim card however in europe it was a different story good voice good sms no data except a very anemic and intermittent g on orange service in france same with vodafone same with o after spending a few hours in an orange shop the tech finally discovered that the data frequencies on which the phone operates are available only in the americas not in europe a solid phone for use in the americas but no global phone by all means i will keep the phone as a backup for us but i will need a different one for my next trip to europe,neutral
i purchased this phone as a emergency replacement for my lg optimus g pro phone build is decent very thin phone the screen is bright and responsive sound speakerphone is rather tinny sounding as the speaker is small phone is very laggy although it has a octo core cpu the phone is held back tremendously by the rather paltry  gb ram if this was a  phone that may have sufficed but the android os has grown and apps and games require much more memory to perform optimally overall ,neutral

first off this is my second review my first review was a  star and did not get posted after i submitted the review i like the phone but need to point out a few things this is an international phone support has to be handled through a country outside of the usa it is difficult to identify what country that is this works for me in this case as i spend lots of time in mexico however for most people this is an issue and if the country it is attached to is africa it becomes a very big issue this phone was not identified as an international phone and the details on this are not made clear to the buyer support becomes difficult and i would at least like to know the details on this when i am buying the phone i would highly suggest to anyone in the usa buying this to just go to bestbuy and pay an extra  bucks i really do not like that my one star review was not posted when i talked with samsung support they told me most of the phones sold as unlocked samsung phones on amazon are from outside the usa and cannot receive support from within the usa this is the last samsung phone i will buy on amazon as this was very nerve racking trying to figure out what the deal is with this phone when i first tried to update the software it said the software had been modified and could not be updated this fault later went away also when buying this it was identified as by samsung the seller was not clear and as i purchased it with prime i assumed it was amazon this is not the case please save yourself some trouble and just buy samsung phones unlocked from bestbuy amazon is great for a lot of things but i feel like this borders on fraud apart from this the phone is great so far,neutral

this is not by far my first phone with att or lg so since i was satisfied with almost all their product previously owned i figured this one would be much the samei was wrong though now lasting a year and still functioning it has many problems first off almost every button you hit can and will connect to the internet costing you money or taking your data time second almost every case i have bought for it hits the power button that despite the key lock on still turns it off third it will not run most apps you can get for it and will not delete the built in ones that take up spaceon the plus though the battery life on this phone is exceptional i can not charge for    days nontalking  just to see though i called a recording and let it be took  hours straight to kill the battery texting with this keyboard and quick message button makes it streamlined and easyall and all i would only give  stars total due to small problems,neutral

i ordered and received an unlocked att version of the phone last week thursday i really like this phone everything about it is wonderful it has  it is good for games music the front and back camera is nice the phone mic is good for calls good signal strength and handy and works well with other sim aside from att the only issue with the phone is the battery i think for a phone of this functionality htc should have given it a better battery lifethe seller claimed that the phone has been upgraded to android  marshmallow but this is not true the phone has a android lollipop this should be corrected and in fairness an update should be made available for those of us that have purchased the phone in the us so we can also enjoy the android  marshmallow on the htc desire eyei would have given it a  star but for the battery life and misrepresentation on the android version running on the phonealbeit im enjoying the phone,neutral

overall i like this phone with the help of some great free apps it is very versatile it has worked well for the time i have had it  months the downside is the battery life less than  hrs weight and the fact that it is difficult slow to turn on and reluctant to turn off i have tried to shut it down at night only to find it still on in the morning with the battery depleted i do not understand why selecting shut down followed by a confirmation that it is shutting down does not turn it off,neutral
first of all the phone is well built and very response with windows phone  os also it has the best camera in the market i was amazed with ithowever the the battery is horrible it dies fast also the cellphones gps is by far the worst of all platforms it takes a while to set directions to a place to another and on walking mode all the time it request to calibrate the gps making you to move the lumia in the  sign while i was walking i stopped several time to recalibrate againactually i returned the lumia  because it came defective the infamous light bleeding displaybut i tell you this i totally recommend the  if you want to take pictures its badass i love camera but i love performance i got the s insteadi hope with windows phone  the lumia  may have performance improved,neutral
i love windows and nokia but the screen is not as sensitive to touch as it should be,neutral
this phone is unbranded meaning you cannot get it from your local att or tmobile store here in the us so since the phone is unbranded forget about customer service help from your wireless carrier all they tell you is contact sony ericsson when you call sony ericsson customer service they are very arrogant and all they try to do is to let you use their support page on their websitethe phone is good looking and solid however many reviewers in other places  have returned their phone due to faulty battery cover that wobbles and the kickstand is loose and does not stay in place unfortunately these problem occurs when your  days are up and you cannot return your product for a full refundse claims a  megapixel camera but that is far from taking great pictures at best their okaythe case ic that se offers for the phone is generic meaning not specially made for this model and when you put the phone in there the latch does not close and you have to force it forcing it touches the off button and your phone is off without you knowing it the belt case is made of plastic that is very hard to use and that it can break easilythe gps program that come preinstalled is wayfinder and it has  it is a european company not even comparable to tomtom garmin telenav does not offer a program for this specific model and their cs is another storyso basically you are paying for a great looking phone without any support from your carrier and sethe music player walkman is great and sounds great youtube application does not work you have to mess with the firmware and it has  it is not recommended for none tech savvy people this is where you find that att does not care since it has  it is not their branded phone and se does not care since they really do not care after they sell you the device and they tell you you should contact your carrierso bottom line if you are tech savvy you have  to burn and you change phone often then yes buy this phone by all mean however if you want tech support cheaper phone buy a branded version from your own wireless carrier,neutral
the nokia  is a good phone but has its downsidespros touch screen is responsive the full keyboard is spacious has a stylus but is not really needed feels sturdy comes with gb of storage decent camera for a cell phone internet browsing is decent comes with wifi and bluetooth good music playerradiocons the memory card is very hard to remove be careful when i tried removing it to transfer data via sd slot the card was such a tight fit the chip was damaged i had to buy another memory card it has not happened again but just the fact this is possible is a fatal flaw in its design the accelerometer is too sensitiveoverallit has  it is a good phone and affordable however not good for anything other than calling or listening to music if you want an internet device go with the higher end smart phones iphone blackberry droid etc,neutral
after saving up for several months i was able to purchase my very first highend phone at the time i first bought this phone it was still considered out of date but i did not care i was very excited to finally have an all in one high quality music player cell phone and handheld computer i remember being most excited besides the app inclusions that this product had  whole gb to play with that was more than id ever had in my mp players ipods of the pastproshuge gb spaceapp storehigh quality music playback however i believe the sansa line of mp players has a much better quality of music playback and higher volume offering this is the only one i have foundglass pieces rather than plasticunlocked for use with multiple phone servicesconsbuggy at timesoutdateddoes not support many appsnew os does not run very smoothly on thisone speaker was bustedgrossly overpricedyou can find an andriod that improves on this system in every way for a quarter of the pricei have since updated to a less expensive android phone with expandable memory lg k as even the cheap ones run better os than this old thing nowadays for the time though this piece of software was very innovative and very exciting to have if you are in the market for a new phone i would recommend a newer piece of equipment though rather than springing for this item even if it is the apple store you are looking for many apps do not even run on this any longer a new andriod would save your pocket some dough and offer you higher improvements,neutral

i waited until i had used this phone for at least  days before forming an opinion i gave up a galaxy s for this and i had read so many great reviews that i thought it had to be a better option wrong some features i like better than the s and some i do not the camera is supposed to be awesome but it has  it is really only average in my opinion since i mostly use my phone to talk and text it serves the purposei do not need a lot of bells and whistles battery lasts longer and that is a plus i will keep it until i can find something better that has  that is about all i can say,neutral

buyer beware  this phone is set up for overseas london england or british numbers prompts and displays i use att wireless and it works fine there is a setting buried deep in the settings prompt to change some of your display language preferences to english but it seems it must be done for every feature instead of converting all features to english it has  it is weird but not impossible to navigate this phone just really annoying since the company clearly knew this item was being shipped to a usa address the conversion should have been done at the factory dont make your customers go thru the hassle,neutral

the phone is of high quality and connected fine in g mode but would not connect in g mode with my att cellular service in maryland usa the reason became apparent when i discovered that the  version was sent with a nonmfg label over mfg label stating it was  the manufacturer label and label under battery cover  see photos showed clearly that this was the  version which has  wcdma and will not allow g on att in the usa i returned it less then  hours after opening it since the sole reason i purchased the phone was because att is dropping g service in my area by the end of  and it seems they have already been decommissioning g on some towers as my coverage has gotten worse on my gonly cell phone both sellers using amazon fulfillment appear to be shipping the  version instead of the  version described on the product page  this is evidenced by the user reviews buyer beware  this phone will not provide g service in the usa,neutral

this item was purchased approximately  months ago the battery life has diminished significantly  down to about  hours with maybe three of those being actual talk time i have not looked into getting a different one yet but because it is connected to the actual phone case i doubt it will be easy or maybe not even possible my husband made me get him a tracfone so this one could charge while he uses the other during the day in addition it is hard to get the ringer volume up high for situations where that might be desired the incoming phone number is rather small on the exterior of the phone and disappears all together when the unit is flipped open the waterresistant claims are undoubtedly true but in my mind water resistant  better durability i did expect a bit more in the way of the unit being able to take a fall however the case is typical lightweight plastic that needs to be pampered as any other would be on a positive note i had no problems activating this nocontract phone,neutral
